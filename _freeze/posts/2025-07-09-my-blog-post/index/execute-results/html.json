Today I would like to talk about some technicalities related to a quite popular statistical methods used in the analysis of trial-based economic evaluations called **seemingly unrelated regression** or **SUR** [@zellner1962efficient]. Apologies for those who are not really into the details of statistical methodology but I hope that sharing more information about these methods may lead to a better understanding of why we should or should not prefer them when analysing cost-effectiveness data compared to altrnative approaches, e.g. a series of independent linear regressions.\n\nIn short, SURs consist in a system of regression equations that are linked to each other by the fact that their residuals are allowed to be correlated. There are two main advantages of using a SUR system compared to fitting a series of separate regressions:\n\n  1. Gain in efficiency by recognising the correlation between individual level outcomes in the parameter estimation [@greene2008econometric].\n  \n  2. Possibility yo impose and/or test restrictions involving parameters in different equations [@fiebig2001seemingly].\n\n# General SUR framework\n\nSuppose $y_{it}$ is a dependent variable, $\\boldsymbol{x}_{it}=(x_{it1},\\ldots,x_{itK})$ is a $K$ vector of explanatory variables for observational unit $i$, and $u_{it}$ is an unobservable error term, where the double index $it$ denotes the $t$-th observation of the $i$-th equation in the system. A classical SUR model is given by the system of linear regression equations\n\n$$\n\\begin{align}\ny_{it}=& \\beta_1 x_{1t} + u_{1t} \\\\\n&\\vdots  \\\\\ny_{Nt}=& \\beta_N x_{Nt} + u_{Nt},\n\\end{align}\n$$\nwhere $i=1,\\ldots,N$, $t=1,\\ldots,T$ and $L=K_1,\\ldots,K_N$. Further simplification can be obtained by stacking observations either in the $t$ or $i$ dimension: for example, if we stack for each observation $t$, let $Y_t=(y_{1t},\\ldots,y_{Nt})^{\\prime}$, $\\boldsymbol X_{t}=\\text{diag}(x_{1t},\\ldots,x_{Nt})$, $U_t=(u_{1t},\\ldots,u_{Nt})^{\\prime}$, and $\\boldsymbol \\beta=(\\beta_1^{\\prime},\\ldots,\\beta_N^{\\prime})^{\\prime}$, then we have\n\n$$\nY_t = \\boldsymbol X_t^{\\prime} \\boldsymbol \\beta + U_t.\n$$\nAlternatively, another way to represent a SUR model is to write it in a form of multivariate regression with parameter restrictions: define $\\boldsymbol X_{t}=[x_{1t}^{\\prime},\\ldots,x_{Nt}^{\\prime}]^{\\prime}$ and $A(\\boldsymbol \\beta)=\\text{diag}(\\beta_1,\\ldots,\\beta_N)$, so that we obtain\n\n$$\nY_t = A(\\boldsymbol \\beta)^\\prime X_t + U_t,\n$$\nwith the coefficients satisfying the restrictions $\\text{vec}(A(\\boldsymbol \\beta))=G \\boldsymbol \\beta$, for some full rank matrix $G$. \n\nIn the classical SUR model we assume that for each $i=1,\\ldots,N$, $\\boldsymbol x_{i}=[x_{i1},\\ldots,x_{iT}]^{\\prime}$ is of full rank $K$ and that, conditional on all the regressors, the errors $U_t$ are $\\text{iid}$ over $t$ with mean zero and homoskedastic variance $\\Sigma=\\text{E}[u_t u_t^{\\prime}\\mid X]$, and that $\\Sigma$ is positive definite with $\\sigma_{ij}=\\text{E}[u_{it} u_{jt}\\mid X]$ denoting the $ij$-th element of $\\Sigma$. Under this assumption the covariance matrix of the errors is given by $\\text{E}[\\text{vec}(U)\\text{vec}(U)^{\\prime}]=\\Sigma \\otimes I_T$.\n\n# SUR applied to trial-based economic evaluations\n\nIn the context of trial-based economic evaluations, particularly in a cross-sectional analysis setting based on some individual level cost and effectiveness measures $(c_{i},e_{i})$, SUR models are typically preferred to the fitting of separate linear regressions as they recognise the correlation between individual costs and health outcomes in the parameter estimation. The set of individual level covariates $(\\boldsymbol x^c_{i},\\boldsymbol x^e_{i})$ can also differ for each endpoint but, often, the same $\\boldsymbol x_i$ are used for each endpoint, so that the model becomes\n\n$$\n\\begin{align}\nc_{i}=& \\boldsymbol \\beta_c \\boldsymbol x_{i} + u_{ci} \\\\\n&\\vdots  \\\\\ne_{i}=& \\boldsymbol \\beta_e \\boldsymbol x_{i} + u_{ei},\n\\end{align}\n$$\nwhere $\\boldsymbol x_{i}$ denotes the set of common individual level covariates, typically including a treatment indicator and other baseline variables, whose regression coefficients are often meant to represent the incremental cost and effectiveness parameters estimated via OLS approach. Typically, SUR assumes that the individual error terms follow a bivariate normal distribution with mean zero and variances $\\sigma^2_c$ and $\\sigma^2_e$, and with the correlation between the outcomes being captured through the correlation parameter $\\rho$ [@gomes2012methods]. \n\n# How to fit SUR models in R ?\n\nIn `R`, the `systemfit` package allows a user to specify multiple equations and fit them in an SUR framework. After doing so, one can perform tests on coefficients across the equations. As an example, let's simulate some bivariate cost and effectiveness data.\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n#load packages\nlibrary(mvtnorm)\nlibrary(systemfit)\n\n#generate bivariate outcome data\nn <- 1000\nSigma <- matrix(c(1, 0.7, 0.7, 1), nrow = 2, ncol = 2, byrow = TRUE) # cov matrix\nmu <- c(E = 0.5, C = 0.5) #mean E and C outcome\nec_data <- rmvnorm(n, mean = mu, sigma = Sigma)\nec_data_new <- ec_data\n#rescale e to 0-1 range\nec_data_new[,1] <- (ec_data[,1]-min(ec_data[,1]))/(max(ec_data[,1])-min(ec_data[,1]))\n#rescale c to 0-1000 range\nec_data_new[,2] <- (ec_data[,2]-min(ec_data[,2]))/(max(ec_data[,2])-min(ec_data[,2]))*1000\n\n#add treatment covariate (under assumption of better outcome and less costs for t=1 vs t=0)\nt_data <- ifelse(ec_data_new[,1]>0.6 & ec_data_new[,2]<500,1,0)\nt_data <- ifelse(ec_data_new[,1]<0.6 & ec_data_new[,2]>500,0,t_data)\nt_data <- ifelse(ec_data_new[,1]<0.6 & ec_data_new[,2]<500,rbinom(1,1,0.5),t_data)\nt_data <- ifelse(ec_data_new[,1]>0.6 & ec_data_new[,2]>500,rbinom(1,1,0.5),t_data)\n\n#obtain data frame\ndata.df <- data.frame(ec_data_new[,1],ec_data_new[,2],t_data)\nnames(data.df) <- c(\"e\",\"c\",\"t\")\n```\n:::\n\n\n\nNext, let's define the two system of equations using the `R` formula notation and pass them in a list to the `systemfit` command. A summary of the `systemfit` first shows a summary of the system, then the separate equations, and then how the residuals of the two equations are related. These are followed by the OLS fits of the separate equations.\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n#write formulae for the two outcome equations\neq_e <- e ~ t\neq_c <- c ~ t\n\n#fit SUR model\nfitsur_ec <- systemfit(list(readreg = eq_e, mathreg = eq_c), data=data.df)\n\n#summarise results\nsummary(fitsur_ec)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\n\nsystemfit results \nmethod: OLS \n\n          N   DF      SSR detRCov  OLS-R2 McElroy-R2\nsystem 2000 1996 25310258 281.502 0.00189   0.032915\n\n           N  DF         SSR        MSE       RMSE       R2   Adj R2\nreadreg 1000 998 2.23759e+01 2.2421e-02   0.149736 0.022027 0.021047\nmathreg 1000 998 2.53102e+07 2.5361e+04 159.251239 0.001890 0.000890\n\nThe covariance matrix of the residuals\n           readreg    mathreg\nreadreg  0.0224207    16.9443\nmathreg 16.9442872 25360.9572\n\nThe correlations of the residuals\n         readreg  mathreg\nreadreg 1.000000 0.710584\nmathreg 0.710584 1.000000\n\n\nOLS estimates for 'readreg' (equation 1)\nModel Formula: e ~ t\n\n              Estimate Std.

In the `summary(fitsur_ec)` output we also see results related to standard testing procedures, such as t and p-values related to the estimated coefficients for each covariate included in each equation within the system. In this case, for both equations, we only have treatment as the covariate, whose coefficients represent the mean incremental between the two groups in terms of effectiveness and cost variables. We can also compute related $95\\%$ confidence intervals using the command `confint(fitsur_ec)`.\n\nFor today it is all and I hope you liked this quick overview of this specific topic. I might decide to do these \"quick\" descriptions of specific methods that are often used in economic evaluations, as I find them to be quite easy to follow and to have a sort of preliminary introduction to the topic under consideration. People may then decide to go in more depth into these topics based on their interest/curiosity, for example by consulting the literature or asking some experts. Till next time!\n\n",
