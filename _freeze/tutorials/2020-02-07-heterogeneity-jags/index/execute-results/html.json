Dialects of the `BUGS` language are implemented within three main projects:\n\n1. **OpenBUGS** - written in component pascal.\n \n2. **JAGS** - (Just Another Gibbs Sampler) - written in `C++`. \n\n3. **STAN** - a dedicated Bayesian modelling framework written in `C++` and implementing *Hamiltonian* MCMC samplers.\n\nWhilst the above programs can be used stand-alone, they do offer the rich data pre-processing and graphical capabilities of `R`, and thus, they are best accessed from within `R` itself. As such there are multiple packages devoted to interfacing with the various software implementations:\n\n* *R2OpenBUGS* - interfaces with `OpenBUGS`\n\n* *R2jags* - interfaces with `JAGS`\n\n* *rstan* - interfaces with `STAN`\n\nThis tutorial will demonstrate how to fit models in `JAGS` (@plummer2004jags) using the package `R2jags` (@su2015package) as interface, which also requires to load some other packages.\n\n# Overview\n\n## Introduction\n\nUp until now (in the proceeding tutorials), the focus has been on models that adhere to specific assumptions about the underlying populations (and data). Indeed, both before and immediately after fitting these models, I have stressed the importance of evaluating and validating the proposed and fitted models to ensure reliability of the models. It is now worth us revisiting those fundamental assumptions as well as exploring the options that are available when the populations (data) do not conform. Let's explore a simple linear regression model to see how each of the assumptions relate to the model.\n\n$$\ny_i = \\beta_0 + \\beta_1x_i + \\epsilon_i \\;\\;\\; \\text{with} \\;\\;\\; \\epsilon_i \\sim \\text{Normal}(0, \\sigma^2).\n$$\n\nThe above simple statistical model models the **linear relationship** of $y_i$ against $x_i$. The residuals ($\\epsilon$) are assumed to be **normally distributed** with a mean of zero and a constant (yet unknown) variance ($\\sigma$, **homogeneity of variance**). The residuals (and thus observations) are also assumed to all be **independent**.\n\nHomogeneity of variance and independence are encapsulated within the single symbol for variance ($\\sigma^2$). In assuming equal variances and independence, we are actually making an assumption about the variance-covariance structure of the populations (and thus residuals). Specifically, we assume that all populations are equally varied and thus can be represented well by a single variance term (all diagonal values in a $N\\times N$ covariance matrix are the same, $\\sigma^2$) and the covariances between each population are zero (off diagonals). In simple regression, each observation (data point) represents a single observation drawn (sampled) from an entire population of possible observations. The above covariance structure thus assumes that the covariance between each population (observation) is zero - that is, each observation is completely independent of each other observation. Whilst it is mathematically convenient when data conform to these conditions (normality, homogeneity of variance, independence and linearity), data often violate one or more of these assumptions. In the following, I want to discuss and explore the causes and options for dealing with non-compliance to each of these conditions. By gaining a better understanding of how the various model fitting engines perform their task, we are better equipped to accommodate aspects of the data that don't otherwise conform to the simple regression assumptions. In this tutorial we specifically focus on the topic of heterogeneity of the variance.\n\n# Dealing with heterogeneity \n\nThe validity and reliability of the above linear models are very much dependent on variance homogeneity. In particular, variances that increase (or decrease) with a change in expected values are substantial violations. Whilst non-normality can also be a source of heterogeneity and therefore normalising can address both issues, heterogeneity can also be independent of normality. Similarly, generalised linear models (that accommodate alternative residual distributions - such as Poisson, Binomial, Gamma, etc) can be useful for more appropriate modelling of both the distribution and variance of a model. However, for Gaussian (normal) models in which there is evidence of heterogeneity of variance, yet no evidence of non-normality, it is also possible to specifically model in an alternative variance structure. For example, we can elect to allow variance to increase proportionally to a covariate. To assist us in the following demonstration, we will generate another data set - one that has heteroskedasticity (unequal variance) by design. Rather than draw each residual (and thus observation) from a normal distribution with a constant standard deviation), we will draw the residuals from normal distributions whose variance is proportional to the $X$ predictor.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nset.seed(126)\nn <- 16\na <- 40  #intercept\nb <- 1.5  #slope\nx <- 1:n  #values of the year covariate\nsigma <- 1.5 * x\nsigma\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\nNA  [1]  1.5  3.0  4.5  6.0  7.5  9.0 10.5 12.0 13.5 15.0 16.5 18.0 19.5 21.0 22.5\nNA [16] 24.0\n```\n\n\n:::\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\neps <- rnorm(n, mean = 0, sd = sigma)  #residuals\ny <- a + b * x + eps  #response variable\n# OR\ny <- (model.matrix(~x) %*% c(a, b)) + eps\ndata.het <- data.frame(y = round(y, 1), x)  #dataset\nhead(data.het)  #print out the first six rows of the data set\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\nNA      y x\nNA 1 42.1 1\nNA 2 44.2 2\nNA 3 41.2 3\nNA 4 51.7 4\nNA 5 43.5 5\nNA 6 48.3 6\n```\n\n\n:::\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# scatterplot of y against x\nlibrary(car)\nscatterplot(y ~ x, data.het)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](index_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-1-1.png){width=672}\n:::\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# regular simple linear regression\ndata.het.lm <- lm(y ~ x, data.het)\n\n# plot of standardised residuals\nplot(rstandard(data.het.lm) ~ fitted(data.het.lm))\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](index_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-1-2.png){width=672}\n:::\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# plot of standardized residuals against the predictor\nplot(rstandard(data.het.lm) ~ x)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](index_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-1-3.png){width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n\nThe above scatterplot suggests that variance may increase with increasing $X$. The residual plot (using standardised residuals) suggests that mean and variance could be related - there is a hint of a wedge-shaped pattern. Importantly, the plot of standardised residuals against the predictor shows the same pattern as the residual plot implying that heterogeneity is likely to be due a relationship between variance $X$. That is, an increase in $X$ is associated with an increase in variance. In response to this, we could incorporate an alternative variance structure. The simple model we fit earlier assumed that the expected values were all drawn from normal distributions with the same level of precision $\\tau$ and therefore variance. This assumption is often summarised as:\n\n$$\n\\boldsymbol V = \\sigma^2 \\times \\boldsymbol I,\n$$\n\nwhere $\\boldsymbol I$ is the $N \\times N$ identity matrix (elements on the main diagonal are one and zero outside) which multipled by the constant value $\\sigma^2$ produces the homoskedastic covariance matrix $\\boldsymbol V$ (elements on the main diagonal are $\\sigma^2$ and zero outside). If, instead, we consider an heteroskedastic covariance matrix then, for example, we could assume that the variance is proportional to the level of the covariate. This assumption can be summarised as:\n\n$$\n\\boldsymbol V = \\sigma^2 \\times X \\times \\boldsymbol I,\n$$\n\nwhere the product of the identity matrix $\\boldsymbol I$ and the covariate-specific values $\\sigma^2 \\times X$ produces the heteroskedastic covariance matrix $\\boldsymbol V$ (elements on the main diagonal are $\\sigma^2 \\times X$ and zero outside). With a couple of small adjustments, we can modify the `JAGS` code in order to accommodate a variance structure in which variance is proportional to the predictor variable. Note that since `JAGS` works with precision ($\\tau=\\frac{1}{\\sigma^2}$), I have elected to express the predictor as $\\frac{1}{x}$. This way the weightings are compatible with precision rather than variance. In previous tutorials, we have used a flat, uniform distribution $[0,100]$ for variance priors. Whilst this is a reasonable choice for a non-informative prior, @gelman2006prior suggest that half-cauchy priors are more appropriate when the number of groups is low.\n\n# Model fitting\n\nThe observed response ($y_i$) are assumed to be drawn from a normal distribution with a given mean ($\\mu$) and standard deviation weighted by $1$ on the value of the covariate ($\\sigma \\times \\omega$). The expected values ($\\mu$) are themselves determined by the linear predictor ($\\beta_0 + \\beta_1x$). In this case, $\\beta_0$ represents the mean of the first group and the set of $\\beta$'s represent the differences between each other group and the first group. MCMC sampling requires priors on all parameters. We will employ weakly informative priors. Specifying 'uninformative' priors is always a bit of a balancing act. If the priors are too vague (wide) the MCMC sampler can wander off into nonscence areas of likelihood rather than concentrate around areas of highest likelihood (desired when wanting the outcomes to be largely driven by the data). On the other hand, if the priors are too strong, they may have an influence on the parameters. In such a simple model, this balance is very forgiving - it is for more complex models that prior choice becomes more important. For this simple model, we will go with zero-centered Gaussian (normal) priors with relatively large standard deviations ($100$) for both the intercept and the treatment effect and a wide half-cauchy ($\\text{scale}=5$) for the standard deviation.\n\n$$\ny_i \\sim N(\\mu_i,\\sigma \\times \\omega),  \n$$\n\nwhere $\\mu_i=\\beta_0 +\\boldsymbol \\beta \\boldsymbol X$. The assumed priors are: $\\beta \\sim N(0,100)$ and $\\sigma \\sim \\text{Cauchy}(0,5)$. We note that we can also indirectly specify the prior on $\\sigma$ by expressing the standard deviation as the ratio between two variable: $\\sigma=\\frac{z}{\\sqrt{\\chi}}$. The numerator is a zero-truncated normally distributed variable $z \\sim N(0, 0.04) I(0,)$, while the denominator is the square root of a variable distributed according to a Gamma distribution $\\chi \\sim \\text{Gamma}(0.5,0.5)$ (equivalent to a $\\chi^2$ distribution with $1$ degrees of freedom).\n\nWe proceed to code the model into `JAGS` (remember that in this software normal distribution are parameterised in terms of precisions $\\tau$ rather than variances, where $\\tau=\\frac{1}{\\sigma^2}$). Note the following example as group means calculated as derived posteriors.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nmodelString = \"\n  model {\n  #Likelihood\n  for (i in 1:n) {\n  y[i]~dnorm(mu[i],tau*(1/x[i]))\n  mu[i] <- beta0+beta1*x[i]\n  }\n\n  #Priors and derivatives\n  beta0 ~ dnorm(0,1.0E-6)\n  beta1 ~ dnorm(0,1.0E-6)\n\n  sigma <- z/sqrt(chSq)    # prior for sigma; cauchy = normal/sqrt(chi^2)\n  z ~ dnorm(0, 0.04)I(0,)\n  chSq ~ dgamma(0.5, 0.5)  # chi^2 with 1 d.f.\n  tau <- pow(sigma, -2)\n  }\n  \"\n\n## write the model to a text file\nwriteLines(modelString, con = \"heteroskModel.txt\")\n```\n:::\n\n\nArrange the data as a list (as required by `JAGS`). As input, `JAGS` will need to be supplied with: the response variable, the predictor matrix, the number of predictors, the total number of observed items.

Recall that the purpose of MCMC sampling is to replicate the posterior distribution of the model likelihood and priors by drawing a known number of samples from this posterior (thereby formulating a probability distribution). This is only reliable if the MCMC samples accurately reflect the posterior. Unfortunately, since we only know the posterior in the most trivial of circumstances, it is necessary to rely on indirect measures of how accurately the MCMC samples are likely to reflect the likelihood. I will briefly outline the most important diagnostics.\n\n* *Traceplots* for each parameter illustrate the MCMC sample values after each successive iteration along the chain. Bad chain mixing (characterised by any sort of pattern) suggests that the MCMC sampling chains may not have completely traversed all features of the posterior distribution and that more iterations are required to ensure the distribution has been accurately represented.\n\n* *Autocorrelation* plot for each parameter illustrate the degree of correlation between MCMC samples separated by different lags. For example, a lag of $0$ represents the degree of correlation between each MCMC sample and itself (obviously this will be a correlation of $1$). A lag of $1$ represents the degree of correlation between each MCMC sample and the next sample along the chain and so on. In order to be able to generate unbiased estimates of parameters, the MCMC samples should be independent (uncorrelated).\n\n* *Potential scale reduction factor* (Rhat) statistic for each parameter provides a measure of sampling efficiency/effectiveness. Ideally, all values should be less than $1.05$. If there are values of $1.05$ or greater it suggests that the sampler was not very efficient or effective. Not only does this mean that the sampler was potentially slower than it could have been but, more importantly, it could indicate that the sampler spent time sampling in a region of the likelihood that is less informative. Such a situation can arise from either a misspecified model or overly vague priors that permit sampling in otherwise nonscence parameter space.\n\nPrior to examining the summaries, we should have explored the convergence diagnostics. We use the package `mcmcplots` to obtain density and trace plots for the effects model as an example. When there are a lot of parameters, this can result in a very large number of traceplots. To focus on just certain parameters, e.g. $\\boldsymbol \\beta$.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nlibrary(mcmcplots)\ndenplot(data.het.r2jags, parms = c(\"beta0\", \"beta1\"))\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](index_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-7-1.png){width=672}\n:::\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\ntraplot(data.het.r2jags, parms = c(\"beta0\", \"beta1\"))\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](index_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-7-2.png){width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n\nTrace plots show no evidence that the chains have not reasonably traversed the entire multidimensional parameter space.

As such, exploration of the residuals should be routine. For more complex models (those that contain multiple effects), it is also advisable to plot the residuals against each of the individual predictors. For sampling designs that involve sample collection over space or time, it is also a good idea to explore whether there are any temporal or spatial patterns in the residuals.\n\nThere are numerous situations (e.g. when applying specific variance-covariance structures to a model) where raw residuals do not reflect the interior workings of the model. Typically, this is because they do not take into account the variance-covariance matrix or assume a very simple variance-covariance matrix. Since the purpose of exploring residuals is to evaluate the model, for these cases, it is arguably better to draw conclusions based on standardized (or studentised) residuals. Unfortunately the definitions of standardised and studentised residuals appears to vary and the two terms get used interchangeably. I will adopt the following definitions:\n\n  * **Standardised residuals**. The raw residuals divided by the true standard deviation of the residuals (which of course is rarely known).\n\n  * **Studentised residuals**. The raw residuals divided by the standard deviation of the residuals. Note that **externally studentised residuals** are calculated by dividing the raw residuals by a unique standard deviation for each observation that is calculated from regressions having left each successive observation out.\n\n  * **Pearson residuals**. The raw residuals divided by the standard deviation of the response variable.\n\nhe mark of a good model is being able to predict well. In an ideal world, we would have sufficiently large sample size as to permit us to hold a fraction (such as $25$%) back thereby allowing us to train the model on $75$% of the data and then see how well the model can predict the withheld $25$%. Unfortunately, such a luxury is still rare. The next best option is to see how well the model can predict the observed data. Models tend to struggle most with the extremes of trends and have particular issues when the extremes approach logical boundaries (such as zero for count data and standard deviations). We can use the fitted model to generate random predicted observations and then explore some properties of these compared to the actual observed data.\n\nRather than dublicate this for both additive and multiplicative models, we will only explore the multiplicative model. Residuals are not computed directly within `JAGS`. However, we can calculate them manually form the posteriors.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nmcmc = data.het.r2jags$BUGSoutput$sims.matrix[, c(\"beta0\", \"beta1\")]\n# generate a model matrix\nnewdata = data.frame(x = data.het$x)\nXmat = model.matrix(~x, newdata)\n## get median parameter estimates\ncoefs = apply(mcmc, 2, median)\nfit = as.vector(coefs %*% t(Xmat))\nresid = data.het$y - fit\n\nlibrary(ggplot2)\nggplot() + geom_point(data = NULL, aes(y = resid, x = fit)) + theme_classic()\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](index_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-10-1.png){width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n\nThe above residual plot would make us believe that we had a homogeneity of variance issue (which we thought we were addressing by defining a model that allowed the variance to be proportional to the predictor). This is because we have plotted the raw residuals rather than residuals that have been standardized by the variances.

While workers attempt to become comfortable with a new statistical framework, it is only natural that they like to evaluate and comprehend new structures and output alongside more familiar concepts.

Whilst it has long been acknowledged that this measure is not appropriate for comparing models (for such purposes information criterion such as AIC are more appropriate), it is nevertheless useful for estimating the amount (percent) of variance explained by the model. In a frequentist context, $R^2$ is calculated as the variance in predicted values divided by the variance in the observed (response) values. Unfortunately, this classical formulation does not translate simply into a Bayesian context since the equivalently calculated numerator can be larger than the an equivalently calculated denominator - thereby resulting in an $R^2$ greater than $100$%. @gelman2019r proposed an alternative formulation in which the denominator comprises the sum of the explained variance and the variance of the residuals.\n\nSo in the standard regression model notation of:\n\n$$\ny_i \\sim \\text{Normal}(\\boldsymbol X \\boldsymbol \\beta, \\sigma),\n$$\n\nthe $R^2$ could be formulated as\n\n$$\nR^2 = \\frac{\\sigma^2_f}{\\sigma^2_f + \\sigma^2_e},\n$$\n\nwhere $\\sigma^2_f=\\text{var}(\\boldsymbol X \\boldsymbol \\beta)$, and for normal models $\\sigma^2_e=\\text{var}(y-\\boldsymbol X \\boldsymbol \\beta)$\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nmcmc <- data.het.r2jags$BUGSoutput$sims.matrix\nXmat = model.matrix(~x, data.het)\ncoefs = mcmc[, c(\"beta0\", \"beta1\")]\nfit = coefs %*% t(Xmat)\nresid = sweep(fit, 2, data.het$y, \"-\")\nvar_f = apply(fit, 1, var)\nvar_e = apply(resid, 1, var)\nR2 = var_f/(var_f + var_e)\ntidyMCMC(as.mcmc(R2), conf.int = TRUE, conf.method = \"HPDinterval\")\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\nNA # A tibble: 1 × 5\nNA   term  estimate std.error conf.low conf.high\nNA   <chr>    <dbl>     <dbl>    <dbl>     <dbl>\nNA 1 var1     0.244     0.108   0.0309     0.440\n```\n\n\n:::\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# for comparison with frequentist summary(lm(y ~ x, data.het))\n```\n:::\n\n\n# Heteroskedasticity with categorical predictors\n\nFor regression models that include a categorical variable (e.g. ANOVA), heterogeneity manifests as vastly different variances for different levels (treatment groups) of the categorical variable. Recall, that this is diagnosed from the relative size of boxplots. Whilst, the degree of group variability may not be related to the means of the groups, having wildly different variances does lead to an increase in standard errors and thus a lowering of power. In such cases, we would like to be able to indicate that the variances should be estimated separately for each group. That is the variance term is multiplied by a different number for each group. The appropriate matrix is referred to as an *Identity matrix*. Again, to assist in the explanation some fabricated ANOVA data - data that has heteroscadasticity by design - will be useful.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nset.seed(126)\nngroups <- 5  #number of populations\nnsample <- 10  #number of reps in each\npop.means <- c(40, 45, 55, 40, 30)  #population mean length\nsigma <- rep(c(6, 4, 2, 0.5, 1), each = nsample)  #residual standard deviation\nn <- ngroups * nsample  #total sample size\neps <- rnorm(n, 0, sigma)  #residuals\nx <- gl(ngroups, nsample, n, lab = LETTERS[1:5])  #factor\nmeans <- rep(pop.means, rep(nsample, ngroups))\nX <- model.matrix(~x - 1)  #create a design matrix\ny <- as.numeric(X %*% pop.means + eps)\ndata.het1 <- data.frame(y, x)\nboxplot(y ~ x, data.het1)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](index_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-20-1.png){width=672}\n:::\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nplot(lm(y ~ x, data.het1), which = 3)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](index_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-20-2.png){width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n\nIt is clear that there is gross heteroskedasticity. The residuals are obviously more spread in some groups than others yet there is no real pattern with means (the residual plot does not show an obvious wedge). Note, for assessing homogeneity of variance, it is best to use the standardised residuals. It turns out that if we switch over to maximum (log) likelihood estimation methods, we can model in a within-group heteroskedasticity structure rather than just assume one very narrow form of variance structure. Lets take a step back and reflect on our simple ANOVA (regression) model that has five groups each with $10$ observations:\n\n$$\ny_i = \\mu + \\alpha_i + \\epsilon, \\;\\;\\; \\text{with} \\;\\;\\; \\epsilon \\sim N(0, \\sigma^2). \n$$\n\nThis is shorthand notation to indicate that the response variable is being modelled against a specific linear predictor and that the residuals follow a normal distribution with a certain variance (that is the same for each group). Rather than assume that the variance of each group is the same, we could relax this a little so as to permit different levels of variance per group:\n\n$$\n\\epsilon \\sim N(0, \\sigma^2_i).\n$$\n\nTo achieve this, we actually multiply the variance matrix by a weighting matrix, where the weights associated with each group are determined by the inverse of the ratio of each group to the first (reference) group:\n\n$$\n\\epsilon \\sim N(0, \\sigma^2_i \\times \\omega).\n$$\n\nSo returning to our five groups of $10$ observations example, the weights would be determined as:\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\ndata.het1.sd <- with(data.het1, tapply(y, x, sd))\n1/(data.het1.sd[1]/data.het1.sd)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\nNA         A         B         C         D         E \nNA 1.0000000 0.6909012 0.4140893 0.1426207 0.3012881\n```\n\n\n:::\n:::\n\n\nThe weights determine the relative amount of each observation that goes into calculating variances.

In this case, we should divide the residuals by the appropriate sigma for associated with that group (level of predictor).\n\n$$\nRes_{ij} = \\frac{Y_{ij} - \\mu_j}{\\sigma_j}\n$$\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nmcmc = data.het1.r2jags$BUGSoutput$sims.matrix\nwch = grep(\"beta\", colnames(mcmc))\ncoefs = mcmc[, wch]\nXmat = model.matrix(~x, data.het1)\nfit = coefs %*% t(Xmat)\nresid = -1 * sweep(fit, 2, data.het1$y, \"-\")\nwch = grep(\"sigma\", colnames(mcmc))\nresid = apply(resid, 2, median)/rep(apply(mcmc[, wch], 2, median), table(data.het1$x))\n# resid = apply(resid,2,median)/(median(mcmc[,'sigma']) * sqrt(data.het1$x))\nfit = apply(fit, 2, median)\nggplot() + geom_point(data = NULL, aes(y = resid, x = fit)) + theme_classic()\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](index_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-28-1.png){width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n\nThis is certainly an improvement. Nevertheless, there is still an indication of a relationship between mean and variance. We could attempt to further address this by refining $\\omega$ in the Bayesian model. That is, rather than indicate that variance is proportional to $x$, we could indicate that variance is proportional to $x^2$ (as an example) - we will leave this as an exercise for the reader.
