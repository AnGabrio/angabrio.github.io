### Abstract

`missingHE` is a `R` package aimed at providing some useful tools to analysts in order to handle missing outcome data under a Full Bayesian framework in economic evaluations. The package relies on the `R` package `R2jags` to implement Bayesian methods via the statistical software `JAGS`. The package allows to obtain inferences using Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) methods under a range of modelling approaches and missing data assumptions. The package also contains functions specifically defined to assess model fit and possible issues in model convergence as well as to summarise the main results from the economic analysis.

Missing data are iteratively imputed using data augmentation methods according to the type of model, distribution and missingness assumptions specified by the user using different arguments in the functions of the package. The posterior distribution of the main quantities of interest (e.g. some suitable measures of costs and clinical benefits) is then summarised to assess the cost-effectiveness of a new intervention ($t=2$) against a standard intervention ($t=1$).

`missingHE` produces plots which compares the observed and imputed values for both cost and benefit measures in each treatment intervention considered to detect possible concerns about the plausibility of the imputation methods. In addition, the output of `missingHE` cab be analysed using different funtions in the `R` package `BCEA` which produces a synthesis of the decision process given the current evidence and uncertainty, as well as several indicators that can be used to perform Probabilistic Sensitivity Analysis to parameter and model uncertainty.

## Example

```{r}
#| eval: true
#| echo: false
#| message: false
#| warning: false

library(missingHE)
MenSS$c <- MenSS$c + 0.05
```

```{r}
#| eval: true
#| echo: true
#| message: false
#| warning: false

library(missingHE)
model.sel <- selection(data = MenSS, model.eff = e ~ u.0, model.cost = c ~ e, model.me = me ~ 1, model.mc = mc ~ 1, type = "MAR", n.chains = 2, n.iter = 1000, n.burnin = 100, dist_e = "norm", dist_c = "norm")
summary(model.sel)
```

## News and updates about missingHE

* From 25/09/2019, the updated version (1.2.1) of `missingHE` has become available on [CRAN](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/missingHE/), which allows to perform posterior predictive checks for each type of model as a further way to assess the fit of the model to the observed data. 

The checks can be done by first setting the optional argument `ppc = TRUE` when fitting the model using one of the main function of the package. For example, when using `selection` to fit selection models you would have something like this:

```{r}
#| eval: false
#| echo: false
#| message: false
#| warning: false

model.sel <- selection(data = data, model.eff = e ~ age, model.cost = c ~ age + e, model.me = me ~ age, model.mc = mc ~ age, dist_e = "norm", dist_c = "gamma", type = "MAR", n.iter = 1000, ppc = TRUE)
```

Then you can use the function `ppc` to perform different types of posterior predictive checks that you can choose among a set of pre-specified types using the `type` argument. For example, if we want to compare histograms of the empirical and predictive distributions of the effectiveness variable in one arm (e.g. control), then we can type

```{r}
#| eval: false
#| echo: false
#| message: false
#| warning: false

ppc(model.sel, type = "histogram", outcome = "effects_arm1")
```

and we get something like this

* From 07/01/2020, the updated version (1.3.2) of `missingHE` has become available on [CRAN](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/missingHE/), which allows to choose among more distributions for the effectiveness measures, including continuous (Gamma, Weibull, Exponential, Logistic), discrete (Poisson, Negative Binomial) and binary (Bernoulli) health outcomes.

For example, we can choose to specify a selection model assuming a Bernoulli distribution for the effects (if this is a binary outcome) and a LogNormal distribution for the costs

```{r}
#| eval: false
#| echo: false
#| message: false
#| warning: false

model.sel <- selection(data = data, model.eff = e ~ age, model.cost = c ~ age + e, model.me = me ~ 1, model.mc = mc ~ 1, dist_e = "bern", dist_c = "lnorm", type = "MAR")
```

* From 30/04/2020, the updated version (1.4.0) of `missingHE` has become available on [CRAN](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/missingHE/), which allows to perform fit random effects for each type of model implemented. The random terms can be specified using the following notation

```{r}
#| eval: false
#| echo: false
#| message: false
#| warning: false

model.sel <- selection(data = data, model.eff = e ~ age + (age | site), model.cost = c ~ age + e + (age + e | site), model.me = me ~ age + (1 | site), model.mc = mc ~ age + (0 + age | site), dist_e = "norm", dist_c = "gamma", type = "MAR", n.iter = 10000, ppc = TRUE)
```

I borrowed this notation, alongside with a couple of internal functions, from the `lme4` package. The terms inside the brackets on the left of the bar are the terms for which the random effects are assumed (these must also be included as fixed effects). The term on the right of the bar is the clustering variable over which the random effects are specified. 

For example the formula ` + (age | site)` specifies random effects for the intercept and `age` across the values of the `site` variable. It aslo possible to specify random slope only models (i.e. remove the random intercept) by adding the term `0 +` inside the brackets on the left of the bar.

All functions in the package have been updated to take into account the possibility that random effects are specified and to perform diagnostic and posterior predictive checks based on the random effects if these are included. In addition, a new generic function called `coef` is now available to extract the fixed or random effect terms from the effectiveness and cost models for each type of model in `missingHE`. For example, we can extract summary statistics for the fixed effects from the fitted selection model by using the command

```{r}
#| eval: false
#| echo: false
#| message: false
#| warning: false

coef(model.sel, random = FALSE)
```

which prints something like this

```{r}
#| eval: false
#| echo: false
#| message: false
#| warning: false

coef(model.sel, random = FALSE)
```

If we set `random = TRUE`, then summary statistics for the random effects terms are printed.

* From 10/06/2020 a new version (1.4.1) of `missingHE` is available to download from my [GitHub](https://github.com/AnGabrio/missingHE) page, which includes three vignettes providing some tutorials on how to use the functions of the package. Each vignette is specifically designed to help different types of users:

  - The first vignette is named *Introduction_to_missingHE* and is designed to provide some introductory summary about the use of the functions of the package based on the default settings, what the user needs to specify and how to interpret and extract the results. See the vignette [here](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/missingHE/vignettes/Introduction_to_missingHE.html)
  
  - The second vignette is named *Fitting_MNAR_models_in_missingHE* and is deisgned to help those who would like to explore MNAR assumptions and how this can be done within each main function of the package. See the vignette [here](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/missingHE/vignettes/Fitting_MNAR_models_in_missingHE.html)
  
  - The third vignette is named *Model_customisation_in_missingHE* and is designed for those who are already familiar with the package but who would like to customise the functions in a more flexible way, for example by including random effects, using different priors or modelling assumptions. See the vignette [here](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/missingHE/vignettes/Model_customisation_in_missingHE.html)

* From 21/03/2023 a new version (4.2.0) of `missingHE` is available to download from my [GitHub](https://github.com/AnGabrio/missingHE) page, which includes an additional vignette providing some tutorials on how to extend the already existing functions within the package to fit longitudinal data. Some functions and options still need to be updated but the default configurations for either `selection`, `pattern`, or `hurdle` functions can now be applied to two-arms within-trial longitudinal data economic evaluations. See the vignette [here](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/missingHE/vignettes/Longitudinal_models_in_missingHE.html)

More information, including new updates, about `missingHE` can be found on my dedicated [GitHub repository](https://github.com/AnGabrio/missingHE) or via the most up to date version of the package on [CRAN](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/missingHE/).

## Installation

There are two ways of installing `missingHE`. A *stable* version (currently 4.2.0) is packaged and available from [CRAN](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/missingHE/). You can simply type on your `R` terminal

```{r}
#| eval: false
#| echo: false
#| message: false
#| warning: false

install.packages("missingHE")
```

The second way involves using the *development* version of `missingHE`, which is available from [GitHub](https://github.com/AnGabrio/missingHE) - this will usually be updated more frequently and may be continuously tested. On Windows machines, you need to install a few dependencies, including Rtools first, e.g. by running

```{r}
#| eval: false
#| echo: false
#| message: false
#| warning: false

pkgs <- c("R2jags","ggplot2","gridExtra","BCEA","ggmcmc","loo","Rtools","devtools", "utils")
repos <- c("https://cran.rstudio.com") 
install.packages(pkgs,repos=repos,dependencies = "Depends")
```

before installing the package using `devtools`:

```{r}
#| eval: false
#| echo: false
#| message: false
#| warning: false

devtools::install_github("AnGabrio/missingHE", build_vignettes = TRUE)
```

The optional argument `build_vignettes = TRUE` allows to install the vignettes of the package locally on your computer. These consist in brief tutorials to guid the user on how to use and customise the models in missingHE using different functions of the package. Once the package is installed, they can be accessed by using the command

```{r}
#| eval: false
#| echo: false
#| message: false
#| warning: false

utils::browseVignettes(package = "missingHE")
```

All models implemented in missingHE are written in the `BUGS` language using the software `JAGS`, which needs to be installed from its own repository and instructions for installations under different OS can be found online. Once installed, the software is called in missingHE via the `R` package `R2jags`. Note that the missingHE package is currently under active development and therefore it is advisable to reinstall the package directly from [GitHub](https://github.com/AnGabrio/missingHE) before each use to ensure that you are using the most updated version.
