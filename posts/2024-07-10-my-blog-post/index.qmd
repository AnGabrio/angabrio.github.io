Dear readers, unfortunately I have some bad news to communicate which relate to my private life as one person very close to me passed away a couple of weeks ago. This has left and will leave a strong impact on my life as it was something quite unexpected. Because of this I also had to cancel my participation to EuHEA 2024 and probably will also need to cancel my attendance at ICTMC 2024 later this autumn.

I want to take some time off to think carefully on how to move on from this point. Of course, routine work must go on but at the moment I am a bit deprived of will to talk happily and enthusiastically about new ideas or things to do. I know and hope this is simply a transition period and that things will become "easier" as tie passes but I also think it is important to take some time off and do a check of my life and take the time needed to re-assess and mentally prepare myself to continue my life in a quite different mindset and using a new perspective. 

I know I talked quite broadly and perhaps in a way that is a bit empty and confusing but I am convinced that I will soon be able to go back to my usual self and give you new updates on my research and ideas. I just ask you to bear with me for a little time, as it is something that I really need before re-starting the usual posting and sharing of news. 

Thank you very much for your understanding and I hope to be able to get back to you soon enough.
