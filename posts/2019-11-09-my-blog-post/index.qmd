I did not have much time to post anything this month until now as it has been a quite busy period. I have been involved in many different works and I have also involved other people in what I think could be some very interesting new projects. Not that I complain about having many different things to do (most of them are actually cool) but doing everything in a short period is not the best. 

A couple of things have come/are coming up. First, I have seriously started working on the coding of a decision model for some health economic evaluation project I have been involved in since last year. Everything seems ok after I spent lots of days and time fixing some small bugs in my code. I am about half way through the model and I hope I will be able to finish it before Christmas (I doubt it though). 

Second, I have finished reviewing an interesting paper about some new methods for improving current practice for dealing with missing data, which I kinda enjoy reading (very good!). 

Third, I would like to quickly summarise my first experience at [ISPOR Europe](https://www.ispor.org/conferences-education/conferences/past-conferences/ispor-europe-2019) in Copenhagen. I was really excited to attend this conference which, as expected, revealed itself as huge with people coming from all over the world and with many interesting sessions and discussion topics. I had the chance to meet new and old people, such as professor [Andrea Manca](https://www.york.ac.uk/che/staff/research/andrea-manca/) and the always very kind [Chris Sampson](https://www.ohe.org/about-us/meet-team/chris-sampson) for whom I was like a stalker asking for more and more information about himself and his work. I also met some of my old collegues from MapiGroup, now under [ICON plc](https://iconplc.com/). It was very fun to hang out with these old friends and see what they have been up to during this time. Among them, I gladly caught up with my dear friend [Ryan Pulleyblank](https://www.iqce.uni-hamburg.de/people/iqce-fellows/ryan-pulleyblank.html), now doing a PhD at the University of Southern Denmark. My poster was a success with (unexpectedly) many people stopping by and asking for more information on my work. I was genuinely surprised by this as ISPOR is mostly a conference dedicated to companies rather than academic works and networking. To sum up, it was a very nice and fun experience and despite the level of statistical methodology was not particularly high I enjoyed my time there and I also had the chance to visit Copenhagen for the first time.  
Finally, as a side note, I have found the time to upload on my arXiv page a nice application of [Bayesian hierarchical models for the prediction of volleyball matches](https://arxiv.org/abs/1911.08791) which I have been working on the past summer, taking inspiration from the work of Gianluca about [predicting football macthes](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/02664760802684177?journalCode=cjas20). I hope my work can turn out in something cool as well.

This is all for the moment but soon I will be heading back to another quite busy period for me. I hope this will be the last for some time, especially given that Christmas is coming and I would like to have some free time to properly enjoy this period, which I really like, even more than Christmas itself.
