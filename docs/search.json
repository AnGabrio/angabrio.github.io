    "text": "We extend and adapt the modelling frameworks typically used for the analysis of football data and propose a novel Bayesian hierarchical modelling framework for the analysis and prediction of volleyball results in regular seasons. Three different sub-models or “modules” form our framework: (1) The module of the observed number of points scored by the two opposing teams in a match (\\(y_h\\) and \\(y_a\\)); (2) the module of the binary indicator for the number of sets played (\\(d^s\\)); (3) the module of the binary indicator for the winner of the match (\\(d^m\\)). These three modules are jointly modelled using a flexible Bayesian parametric approach, which allows to fully propagate the uncertainty for each unobserved quantity and to assess the predictive performance of the model in a relatively easy way. In the following, we describe the notation and the model used in each of the three modules.\n\n\nIn the first module of the framework, we model the number of points scored by the home and away team in the \\(i\\)-th match of the season \\(\\boldsymbol y=(y_{hi},y_{ai})\\) using two independent Poisson distributions, as shown in Equation 1 and Equation 2:\n\\[\ny_{hi} \\sim Poisson(\\theta_{hi}),\n\\tag{1}\\]\n\\[\ny_{ai} \\sim Poisson(\\theta_{ai}),\n\\tag{2}\\]\nconditionally on the set of parameters \\(\\boldsymbol \\theta=(\\theta_{hi},\\theta_{ai})\\), representing the scoring intensity in the \\(i\\)-th match for the home and away team, respectively. These parameters are then modelled using the log-linear regressions, as shown in Equation 3 and Equation 4:\n\\[\nlog(\\theta_{hi}) =\\mu + \\lambda + att_{h(i)} + def_{a(i)},\n\\tag{3}\\]\n\\[\nlog(\\theta_{ai}) =\\mu + att_{a(i)} + def_{h(i)},\n\\tag{4}\\]\nwhich corresponds to a Poisson log-linear model. Within these formulae, \\(\\mu\\) is a constant, while \\(\\lambda\\) can be identified as the home effect and represents the advantage for the team hosting the game which is typically assumed to be constant for all the teams and throughout the season. The overall offensive and defensive performances of the \\(k\\)-th team is captured by the parameters \\(att\\) and \\(def\\), whose nested indexes \\(h(i), a(i)=1,\\ldots,K\\) identify the home and away team in the \\(i\\)-th game of the season, where \\(K\\) denotes the total number of the teams.\nWe then expand the modelling framework to incorporate match-specific statistics related to the offensive and defensive performances of the home and away teams. More specifically, Equation 5 and Equation 6 show the effects associated with the attack intensity of the home teams and the defence effect of the away teams:\n\\[\natt_{h(i)} =\\alpha_{0h(i)} + \\alpha_{1h(i)}att^{eff}_{hi} + \\alpha_{2h(i)}ser^{eff}_{hi},\n\\tag{5}\\]\n\\[\ndef_{a(i)} =\\beta_{0a(i)} + \\beta_{1a(i)}def^{eff}_{ai} + \\beta_{2a(i)}blo^{eff}_{ai}.\n\\tag{6}\\]\nWe omit the index \\(i\\) from the terms to the left-hand side of the above formulae to ease notation, i.e. \\(att_{h(i)}=att_{h(i)i}\\) and \\(def_{a(i)}=def_{a(i)i}\\). The overall offensive effect of the home teams is a function of a baseline team specific parameter \\(\\alpha_{0h(i)}\\), and the attack and serve efficiencies of the home team, whose impact is captured by the parameters \\(\\alpha_{1h(i)}\\) and \\(\\alpha_{2h(i)}\\). The overall defensive effect of the away team is a function of a baseline team-specific parameter \\(\\beta_{0a(i)}\\), and the defence and block efficiencies of the away team, whose impact is captured by the parameters \\(\\beta_{1a(i)}\\) and \\(\\beta_{2a(i)}\\), respectively. Similarly, Equation 7 and Equation 8 show the effects associated with the attack intensity of the away teams and the defence effect of the home teams:\n\\[\natt_{a(i)} =\\alpha_{0a(i)} + \\alpha_{1a(i)}att^{eff}_{ai}+ \\alpha_{2a(i)}ser^{eff}_{ai},\n\\tag{7}\\]\n\\[\ndef_{h(i)} =\\beta_{0h(i)} + \\beta_{1h(i)}def^{eff}_{hi}+ \\beta_{2h(i)}blo^{eff}_{hi},\n\\tag{8}\\]\nTo achieve identifiability of the model, a set of parametric constraints needs to be imposed. We impose sum-to-zero constraints on the team-specific parameters, i.e. we set \\(\\sum_{k=1}^{K}\\alpha_{jk}=0\\) and \\(\\sum_{k=1}^{K}\\beta_{jk}=0\\), for \\(k=1,\\ldots,K\\) and \\(j=(0,1,2)\\). Under this set of constraints, the overall offensive and defensive effects of the teams are expressed as departures from a team of average offensive and defensive performance. Within a Bayesian framework, prior distributions need to be specified for all random parameters in the model. Weakly informative Normal distributions centred at \\(0\\) with a relatively large variances are specified for the fixed effect parameters.\n\n\n\nIn the second module, we explicitly model the chance of playing \\(5\\) sets in the \\(i\\)-th match of the season, i.e. the sum of the sets won by the home (\\(s_{hi}\\)) and away (\\(s_{ai}\\)) team is equal to \\(5\\). This is necessary when generating predictions in order to correctly assign the points to the winning/losing teams throughout the season and evaluate the rankings of the teams at the end of the season. We model the indicator variable \\(d^s_{i}\\), taking value \\(1\\) if \\(5\\) sets were played in the \\(i-\\)th match and \\(0\\) otherwise, as shown in Equation 9 and Equation 10, using a Bernoulli distribution\n\\[\nd^s_{i}:=\\mathbb{I}(s_{hi}+s_{ai}=5)\\sim\\mbox{Bernoulli}(\\pi^s_{i}),\n\\tag{9}\\]\nwhere\n\\[\nlogit(\\pi^s_{i})= \\gamma_0 + \\gamma_1y_{hi} + \\gamma_2y_{ai}.  \n\\tag{10}\\]\n\n\n\nThe last module deals with the chance of the home team to win the \\(i\\)-th match, i.e. the total number of sets won by the home team (\\(s_{hi}\\)) is larger than that of the away team (\\(s_{ai}\\)) – we note that we could have also equivalently decided to model the chance of the away team to win the \\(i\\)-th match. This part of the model is again necessary when predicting the results for future matches, since the team associated with the higher number of points scored in the \\(i\\)-th match may not correspond to the winning team. We model the indicator variable \\(d^m_{i}\\), taking value \\(1\\) if the home team won the \\(i-\\)th match and \\(0\\) otherwise, as shown in Equation 11 and Equation 12, using another Bernoulli distribution\n\\[\nd^m_{i}:=\\mathbb{I}(s_{hi}&gt;s_{ai}) \\sim\\mbox{Bernoulli}(\\pi^m_{i}),\n\\tag{11}\\]\nwhere\n\\[\nlogit(\\pi^m_{i})= \\eta_0 + \\eta_1y_{hi} + \\eta_2y_{ai} + \\eta_3 d^s_i.\n\\tag{12}\\]\nFigure 1 shows a graphical representation of the modelling framework proposed.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1: Graphical representation of the modelling framework.\n\n\n\nThe framework corresponds to a joint distribution for all the observed quantities which are explicitly modelled. This is factored into the product of the marginal distribution of the total number of points scored by the two teams in each match, Module 1 – \\(p(\\boldsymbol y)\\), the conditional distribution of the probability of playing \\(5\\) sets in a match given \\(\\boldsymbol y\\), Module 2 – \\(p(d^s_i \\mid \\boldsymbol y)\\), and the conditional probability of winning the match given \\(\\boldsymbol y\\) and \\(d^s_i\\), Module 3 – \\(p(d^m_i\\mid \\boldsymbol y, d^s_i)\\). Module 1 also includes the different in-game statistics as covariates in the model. These are related to the either the offensive (serve and attack efficiency) or defensive (defence and block efficiency) effects of the home and away teams in each match of the season, and are respectively denoted in the graph as \\(\\boldsymbol x^{att}_{ti}=(ser^{eff}_{ti}, att^{eff}_{ti})\\) and \\(\\boldsymbol x^{def}_{ti}=(def^{eff}_{ti}, blo^{eff}_{ti})\\) to ease notation, for \\(t=(h,a)\\).\n\n\n\nAlthough the individual-level correlation between the observable variables \\(y_{hi}\\) and \\(y_{ai}\\) is taken into account through the hierarchical structure of the framework, a potential limitation of the model is that it ignores the possible multilevel correlation between the team-specific offensive \\(\\alpha_{jk}\\) and defensive \\(\\beta_{jk}\\) coefficients, for \\(j=(0,1,2)\\) and \\(k=1,\\ldots,K\\). In an alternative analysis, we account for the multilevel correlation using Inverse-Wishart distributions on the covariance matrix of the team specific parameters $ {}$ and $ {}$, which are scaled in order to facilitate the specification of the priors."

    "title": "A review of heath economic evaluation practice in the Netherlands: are we moving forward?",
    "section": "",
    "text": "Introduction\nIn the Netherlands, the Dutch National Health Care Institute (Zorginstituut Nederland or ZIN) is the body in charge of issuing recommendations and guidance on good practice in health economic evaluations, not just for pharmaceutical products, but also in relation to other fields of application such as medical devices, long-term care and forensics. In 2016, ZIN issued an update on the guidance for health economic evaluations, which aggregated into a single document and revised three separately published guidelines for pharmacoeconomics evaluation, outcomes research and costing manual. The novel aspects and future policy direction introduced by these guidelines have already been object of discussion, particularly with respect to the potential impact and concerns associated with their implementation in standard health economics practice in the Netherlands. Given the importance covered by these guidelines, an assessment of their impact on economic evaluation practice is desirable.\nThe objective of this paper was to review the evolution of health economic evaluation practice in the Netherlands before and after the introduction of the ZIN’s 2016 guidelines. Based on some key components within the health economics framework addressed by the new guidelines, we specifically focus on reviewing the statistical methods, missing data methods and software implemented by health economists. Given the intrinsic complexity of analysing health economics data, the choice of the analytical approaches to deal with these problems as well as transparent information on their implementation is crucial in determining the degree of confidence that decision-makers should have towards cost-effectiveness results obtained from these studies\n\n\nThe ZIN 2016 guidelines\nThe main objective of the guidelines is to ensure the comparability and quality of health economic evaluations in the Netherlands, therefore facilitating the task of the decision-maker regarding the reimbursement of new health care interventions. Following the example of guidelines issued by decision-making bodies in other countries, including the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) in the UK, the recommended features for economic evaluations are summarised in a typical scenario referred to as ‘reference case’, although deviations from it are allowed when properly justified.\nBased on the structure of the reference case, four essential components of a health economic evaluation are identified: framework, analytic approach, input data and reporting. For the purpose of the review, we only focus on these components in the reference case as the main elements upon which evaluating health economics practice.\n\n\nMethods\nWe performed a bibliographic search in June 2021 using search engines of two online full-text journal repositories: (1) PubMed and (2) Zorginstituut. These sources were chosen to maximise the number of studies that could be accessed given the scoping nature of the review and the lack of a search strategy based on a pre-defined and rigid approach typical of systematic reviews. Articles were considered eligible for the review only if they were cost-effectiveness or cost-utility analyses targeting a Dutch population. To allow the inclusion of a reasonable amount of studies, the key words used in the search strategy were (cost-effectiveness OR cost-utility OR economic evaluation), and we targeted studies published between January 2016 and April 2021.\n\n\nAnalytic approaches\nAlmost all reviewed empirical analyses used bootstrapping (95%), although the number of replications varied largely across the studies, with the most popular choices being 5000 (55%) followed by 2000 (29%). Studies showed even more variability in the choice of the methods used in combination with bootstrapping. Seven general classes of statistical approaches were identified, among which unadjusted methods were the most popular choice across both time periods. A clear change in the type of statistical methods used between the two periods is denoted by a strong decrease (from 64 to 39) in the number of unadjusted analyses in 2016–2020 compared to the earlier period, which is compensated by a rise in the number of adjusted analyses using either SUR or linear mixed effects model (LMM) methods.\nFrom Figure 1 we can look at the different type and combination of software programs used as an indication of the implementation preferences of analysts for health economic evaluations. Although in principle the choice of software should have no impact on the quality of the statistical methods implemented, it has been highlighted how use of simpler software (e.g. spreadsheet calculators such as Excel) may become increasingly cumbersome for matching more realistic and therefore complex modelling requirements.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1: Heatmap of the combination of software programs used\n\n\n\nThe most popular software was SPSS, chosen by 87 (52%) of the studies, either in the base-case (33%) or secondary (19%) analyses, often used in combination with Excel or by itself. When either STATA (26%) or R (13%) was used in the base-case analysis, SPSS was still the most popular choice in secondary analyses. Other combinations of software were less frequently chosen, even though 38 (23%) of the studies were unclear about the software implemented.\n\n\nMissing data methods\nAcross both periods limited changes are observed in terms of order of choice for missing data methods, with MI being the most popular base-case analysis, followed by complete case analysis (CCA), as the most popular SA choice. However, two noticeable variations in the frequency of these methods are observed between the two periods. First, the proportion of studies using MI in the base-case analysis has considerably increased over time (from 28 to 39%), which is compensated by a decrease in the proportion of less advanced methods such as CCA (from 14 to 5%) and single imputation (SI) (from 21 to 16%). Second, the number of studies not clearly reporting the methods has also considerably decreased (from 12 to 5%). The observed trend between the two periods may be the result of the specific recommendations from the 2016 guidelines in regards to the ‘optimal’ missing data strategy, resulting in a more frequent adoption of MI techniques and, at the same time, a less frequent use of CCA in the base-case analysis. However, in contrast to these guidelines, a large number of studies still does not perform any SA to missing data assumptions (about 65% in 2010–2015 and 63% in 2016–2020).\nMost of the studies lie in the middle and lower parts of the plot, and are associated with a limited or sufficient quality of information. However, only a few of these studies rely on very strong and unjustified missing data assumptions, while the majority provides either adequate justifications or uses methods associated with weak assumptions. Only 11 (14%) studies are associated with both high-quality scores and less restrictive missingness assumptions. No study was associated with either full information or adequate justifications for the assumptions explored in base-case and sensitivity analysis.\n\n\nDiscussion\nDescriptive information extracted from the reviewed studies provides some first insights about changes in practice in the years following the publication of the guidelines. First, a clear trend is observed towards an increase in the adoption of a societal and health care perspective and of CUA as the reference base-case analysis approach. Second, a similar increment is observed in the use of recommended instruments for the collection and valuation of health economic outcomes, such as EQ-5D-5L for QALYs and friction method for costs. Most of these changes are in accordance with the 2016 guidelines, which are likely to have played a role in influencing analysts and practitioners towards a clearer and more standardised way to report health economic results.\nWhen looking at the type of statistical methods used to perform the analysis, an important shift occurs between the two periods towards the use of methods that allow for regression adjustment, with a considerable uptake in the use of SURs and LMMs in the context of empirical analyses. These techniques are strongly supported by the 2016 guidelines in that they allow us to correct for potential bias due to confounding effects, deal with clustered data and formally take into account the correlation between costs and effects. Bootstrapping remains the most popular methods to quantify uncertainty around parameter estimates across both periods. However, the health economic analysis framework requires that the level of complexity of the analysis model is reflected in the way uncertainty surrounding the estimates is generated.\nThe transition between the two time periods reveals an increase in the use of MI techniques in the base-case analysis together with a decrease in the overall use of CCA. This change is in line with the 2016 guidelines which warns about the inherent limitations and potential bias of simple methods (e.g. CCA) when compared to MI as the potential reference method to handle missing values. Nevertheless, improvements are still needed given that many studies (more than 6%) performed the analysis under a single missing data assumption. This is not ideal since by definition missing data assumptions can never be checked, making the results obtained under a specific method (i.e. assumption) potentially biased.\n\n\nConclusions\nGiven the complexity of the health economics framework, the implementation of simple but likely inadequate analytic approaches may lead to imprecise cost-effectiveness results. This is a potentially serious issue for bodies such as ZIN in the Netherlands that use these evaluations in their decision making, thus possibly leading to incorrect policy decisions about the cost-effectiveness of new health care interventions. Our review shows, over time, a change in common practice with respect to different analysis components in accordance with the recent ZIN’s 2016 guidelines. This is an encouraging movement towards the standardised use of more suitable and robust analytic methods in terms of both statistical, uncertainty and missing data analysis. Improvements are however still needed, particularly in the choice of adequate statistical techniques to deal with the complexity of the data analysed and in the assessment of the impact of alternative missing data assumptions on the results in SA."

    "text": "Economic evaluation alongside Randomised Clinical Trials (RCTs) is an important and increasingly popular component of the process of technology appraisal. The typical analysis of individual level data involves the comparison of two interventions for which suitable measures of clinical benefits and costs are observed on each patient enrolled in the trial at different time points throughout the follow up. Individual level data from RCTs are almost invariably affected by missingness. The recorded outcome process is often incomplete due to individuals who drop out or are observed intermittently throughout the study, causing some observations to be missing. In most applications, the economic evaluation is performed on the cross-sectional variables, computed using only the data from the individuals who are observed at each time point in the trial (completers), with at most limited sensitivity analysis to missingness assumptions. This, however, is an extremely inefficient approach as the information from the responses of all partially observed subjects is completely lost and it is also likely biased unless the completers are a random sample of the subjects on each arm. The problem of missingness is often embedded within a more complex framework, which makes the modelling task in economic evaluations particularly challenging. Specifically, the effectiveness and cost data typically present a series of complexities that need to be simultaneously addressed to avoid biased results.\nUsing a recent randomised trial as our motivating example, we present a Bayesian parametric model for conducting inference on a bivariate health economic longitudinal response. We specify our model to account for the different types of complexities affecting the data while accommodating a sensitivity analysis to explore the impact of alternative missingness assumptions on the inferences and on the decision-making process for health technology assessment."

In particular, the joint distribution for \\(\\boldsymbol y_{ijt}\\) is specified as a series of conditional distributions that capture the dependence between utilities and costs as well as the time dependence.\nFollowing the recommendations from the published literature, we account for the skewness using Beta and Log-Normal distributions for the utilities and costs, respectively. Since the Beta distribution does not allow for negative values, we scaled the utilities on \\([0,1]\\) through the transformation \\(u^{\\star}_{ij}=\\frac{u_{ij}-\\text{min}(\\boldsymbol u_{j})}{\\text{max}(\\boldsymbol u_{j})-\\text{min}(\\boldsymbol u_{j})}\\), and fit the model to these transformed variables. To account for the structural values \\(u_{ij} = 1\\) and \\(c_{ij} = 0\\) we use a hurdle approach by including in the model the indicator variables \\(d^u_{ij}:=\\mathbb{I}(u_{ij}=1)\\) and \\(d^c_{ij}:=\\mathbb{I}(c_{ij}=0)\\), which take value \\(1\\) if subject \\(i\\) is associated with a structural value at time \\(j\\) and 0 otherwise. The probabilities of observing these values, as well as the mean of each variable, are then modelled conditionally on other variables via linear regressions defined on the logit or log scale. Specifically, at time \\(j=1,2\\), the probability of observing a zero and the mean costs are modelled conditionally on the utilities and costs at the previous times, while the probability of observing a one and the mean utilities are modelled conditionally on the current costs (also at \\(j=0\\)) and the utilities at the previous times (only at \\(j=\\{1,2\\}\\)). The model is summarised by Figure 1:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1: Longitudinal model for missingness.\n\n\n\nWe use partial identifying restrictions to link the observed data distribution \\(p(\\boldsymbol y_{obs},\\boldsymbol r)\\) to the extrapolation distribution \\(p(\\boldsymbol y_{mis} \\mid \\boldsymbol y_{obs},\\boldsymbol r)\\) and consider interpretable deviations from a benchmark scenario to assess how inferences are driven by our assumptions. Specifically, we identify the marginal mean of the missing responses in each pattern \\(\\boldsymbol y^{\\boldsymbol r}_{mis}\\) by averaging across the corresponding components that are observed and add the sensitivity parameters \\(\\boldsymbol \\Delta_j\\).\nWe define \\(\\boldsymbol \\Delta_j=(\\Delta_{c_{j}},\\Delta_{u_{j}})\\) to be time-specific location shifts at the marginal mean in each pattern and set \\(\\boldsymbol \\Delta_j = \\boldsymbol 0\\) as the benchmark scenario. We then explore departures from this benchmark using alternative priors on \\(\\boldsymbol \\Delta_j\\), which are calibrated using the observed standard deviations for costs and utilities at each time \\(j\\) to define the amplitude of the departures from \\(\\boldsymbol \\Delta_j=\\boldsymbol 0\\)."

    "section": "",
    "text": "Introduction\nCost‐effectiveness analyses (CEAs) conducted alongside randomised controlled trials are an important source of information for decision-makers in the process of technology appraisal (Ramsey et al., 2015). The analysis is based on healthcare outcome data and health service use, typically collected at multiple time points and then combined into overall measures of effectiveness and cost. A popular approach to handle missingness is to discard the participants with incomplete observations (complete case analysis or CCA), allowing for derivation of the overall measures based on the completers alone. We note that slightly different definitions of CCA are possible, depending on the form of the model of interest, the type of missingness and the inclusion of observed covariates. This approach, although appealing by its simplicity, has well-recognised limitations including loss of efficiency and an increased risk of bias. We propose the use of linear mixed effects models (LMMs) as an alternative approach under MAR. LMMs are commonly used for the modelling of dependent data (e.g. repeated-measures) and belong to the general class of likelihood-based methods. LMMs appear surprisingly uncommon for the analysis of repeated measures in trial-based CEA, perhaps because of a lack of awareness or familiarity with fitting LMMs.\n\n\nMethods\nLinear mixed model extends the usual linear model framework by the addition of “random effect” terms, which can take into account the dependence between observations.\n\\[\nY_{ij}=\\beta_1+\\beta_2 X_{i1}+\\ldots+\\beta_(P+1) X_{iP}+\\omega_i+\\epsilon_{ij},\n\\tag{1}\\]\nwhere \\(Y_{ij}\\) denotes the outcome repeatedly collected for each individual \\(i=1,\\ldots,N\\) at multiple times \\(j=1,\\ldots,J\\). The model parameters commonly referred to as fixed effects include an intercept \\(\\beta_1\\) and the coefficients \\((\\beta_2,\\ldots,\\beta_{(P+1)})\\) associated with the predictors \\(X_{i1},\\ldots,X_{iP}\\), while \\(\\omega_i\\) and \\(\\epsilon_{ij}\\) are two random terms: \\(\\epsilon_{ij}\\) is the usual error term and \\(\\omega_i\\) is a random intercept which captures variation in outcomes between individuals. The models can be extended to deal with more complex structures, for example by allowing the effect of the covariates to vary across individuals (random slope) or a different covariance structure of the errors. LMMs can be fitted even if some outcome data are missing and provide correct inferences under MAR.\nA particular type of LMMs commonly used in the analysis of repeated measures in clinical trials is referred to as Mixed Model for Repeated Measurement (MMRM). The model includes a categorical effect for time, an interaction between time and treatment arm, and allows errors to have different variance and correlation over time (i.e. unstructured covariance structure). Figure 1 shows some examples of possible covariance structures that may be explored for LMMs.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1: Some examples of covariance structures in LMM\n\n\n\nIncremental (between-group) or marginal (within-group) estimates for aggregated outcomes over the trial period, such as quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) or total costs can be retrieved as linear combinations of the parameter estimates from Equation 1. For example, the mean difference in total cost is obtained by summing up the estimated differences at each follow-up point, while differences on a QALY scale can be obtained as weighted linear combinations of the coefficient estimates of the utility model.\n\n\nConclusions\nWe believe LMMs represent an alternative approach which can overcome some of these limitations.\n\nFirst, practitioners may be more comfortable with the standard regression framework.\nSecond, LMMs can be tailored to address other data features (e.g. cluster-randomised trials or non-normal distribution) while also easily combined with bootstrapping.\nThird, LMMs do not rely on imputation, and results are therefore deterministic and easily reproducible, whereas the Monte Carlo error associated with multiple imputation may cause results to vary from one imputation to another, unless the number of imputations is sufficiently large.\n\nAlthough the methodology illustrated is already known, particularly in the area of statistical analyses, to our knowledge LMMs have rarely been applied to health economic data collected alongside randomised trials. We believe the proposed methods is preferable to a complete-case analysis when CEA data are incomplete, and that it can offer an interesting alternative to imputation methods."

    "section": "",
    "text": "Modelling Framework\nWe propose a unified Bayesian framework that jointly accounts for the typical complexities of the data (e.g. correlation, skewness, spikes at the boundaries and missingness), and that can be implemented in a relatively easy way.\nConsider the usual cross-sectional bivariate outcome formed by the QALYs and total cost variables \\((e_{it}, c_{it})\\) calculated for the \\(i-\\)th person in group \\(t\\) of the trial. To simplify the notation, unless necessary, we suppress the treatment indicator \\(t\\). Equation 1 specifies the joint distribution \\(p(e_i,c_i)\\) as\n\\[\np(e_i,c_i) = p(c_i)p(e_i\\mid c_i) = p(e_i)p(c_i\\mid e_i)\n\\tag{1}\\]\nwhere, for example, \\(p(e_i)\\) is the marginal distribution of the QALYs and \\(p(c_i\\mid e_i)\\) is the conditional distribution of the costs given the QALYs. Note that, although the two factorisations are mathematically equivalent, the choice of which to use has different practical implications. From a statistical point of view, the factorisations require the specifications of different statistical models, e.g. \\(p(e_i)\\) or \\(p(e_i\\mid c_i)\\), which may have different approximation errors. From a clinical point of view, the two versions make different assumptions about the casual relationships between the outcomes, i.e. either \\(e_i\\) determines \\(c_i\\) or vice versa. We describe our analysis under the assumption that the costs are determined by the effectiveness measures and therefore we specify the joint distribution \\(p(e_i,c_i)\\) in terms of a marginal distribution for the QALYs and a conditional distribution for the costs.\nFor each individual we consider a marginal distribution \\(p(e_i \\mid \\boldsymbol \\theta_e)\\) indexed by a set of parameters \\(\\boldsymbol \\theta_e\\) comprising a location \\(\\boldsymbol \\phi_{ie}\\) and a set of ancillary parameters \\(\\boldsymbol\\psi_e\\) typically including some measure of marginal variance \\(\\sigma^2_e\\). Equation 2 models the location parameter using a generalised linear structure\n\\[\ng_e(\\phi_{ie})= \\alpha_0 \\,\\,[+ \\ldots]\n\\tag{2}\\]\nwhere \\(\\alpha\\_0\\) is the intercept and the notation \\([+\\ldots]\\) indicates that other terms (e.g. quantifying the effect of relevant covariates) may or may not be included. In the absence of covariates or assuming that a centered version \\(x_i^{\\star} = (x_i - \\bar{x})\\) is used, the parameter \\(\\mu_e = g_e^{-1}(\\alpha_0)\\) represents the population average QALYs. For the costs, we consider a conditional model \\(p(c_i\\mid e_i,\\boldsymbol\\theta_c)\\), which explicitly depends on the QALYs, as well as on a set of quantities \\(\\boldsymbol\\theta_c\\), again comprising a location \\(\\phi_{ic}\\) and ancillary parameters \\(\\boldsymbol \\psi_{c}\\). For example, when normal distributions are assumed for both \\(p(e_i \\mid \\boldsymbol \\theta\\_e)\\) and \\(p(c_i \\mid e_i, \\boldsymbol \\theta_c)\\), i.e. bivariate normal on both outcomes, the ancillary parameters \\(\\boldsymbol\\psi_c\\) include a conditional variance \\(\\tau^2_c\\), which can be expressed as a function of the marginal variance \\(\\sigma^2_c\\). More specifically, the conditional variance of \\(p(c_i \\mid e_i, \\boldsymbol \\theta_c)\\) is a function of the marginal effectiveness and cost variances and has the closed form \\(\\tau^2_c=\\sigma^2_c - \\sigma^2_e \\beta^2\\), where \\(\\beta=\\rho \\frac{\\sigma_c}{\\sigma_e}\\) and \\(\\rho\\) is the parameter capturing the correlation between the variables.\nEquation 3 models the location as a function of the QALYs as\n\\[\ng\\_c(\\phi\\_{ic}) = \\beta\\_{0} + \\beta\\_{1}(e\\_{i}-\\mu\\_{e})\\,\\,[+\\ldots]\n\\tag{3}\\]\nHere, \\((e_i-\\mu_e)\\) is the centered version of the QALYs, while \\(\\beta_{1}\\) quantifies the correlation between costs and QALYs. Assuming other covariates are either also centered or absent, \\(\\mu_c = g_c^{-1}(\\beta_{0})\\) is the estimated population average cost. The Figure 1 shows a graphical representation of the general modelling framework.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1: Modelling framework.\n\n\n\nThe QALYs and cost distributions are represented in terms of combined modules, the blue and the red boxes, in which the random quantities are linked through logical relationships. This ensures the full characterisation of the uncertainty for each variable in the model. Notably, this is general enough to be extended to any suitable distributional assumption, as well as to handle covariates in either or both the modules.\nThe proposed framework allows jointly tackling of the different complexities that affect the data in a relatively easy way by means of its modular structure and flexible choice for the distributions of the QALYs and cost variables. Using the MenSS trial as motivating example, we start from the original analysis and expand the model using alternative specifications that progressively account for an increasing number of complexities in the outcomes. We specifically focus on appropriately modelling spikes at the boundary and missingness, as they have substantial implications in terms of inferences and, crucially, cost-effectiveness results.\n\n\nExample\nThree model specifications are considered and applied to QALY data from a RCT case study: 1) Normal marginal for the QALYs and Normal conditional for the costs (which is identical to a Bivariate Normal distribution for the two outcomes); 2) Beta marginal for the QALYs and Gamma conditional for the costs; and 3) Hurdle Model. Figure 2 shows the observed QALYs in both treatment groups (indicated with black crosses) as well as summaries of the posterior distributions for the imputed values, obtained from each model. Imputations are distinguished based on whether the corresponding baseline utility value is observed or missing (blue or red lines and dots, respectively) and are summarised in terms of posterior mean and \\(90\\%\\) HPD intervals.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2: Imputed QALYs under alternative model specifications.\n\n\n\nThere are clear differences in the imputed values and corresponding credible intervals between the three models in both treatment groups. Neither the Bivariate Normal nor the Beta-Gamma models produce imputed values that capture the structural one component in the data. In addition, as to be expected, the Bivariate Normal fails to respect the natural support for the observed QALYs, with many of the imputations exceeding the unit threshold bound. These unrealistic imputed values highlight the inadequacy of the Normal distribution for the data and may lead to distorted inferences. Conversely, imputations under the Hurdle Model are more realistic, as they can replicate values in the whole range of the observed data, including the structural ones. Imputed unit QALYs with no discernible interval are only observed in the intervention group due to the original data composition, i.e. individuals associated with a unit baseline utility and missing QALYs are almost exclusively present in the intervention group.\n\n\nConclusions\nWe have presented a flexible Bayesian framework that can handle the typical complexities affecting outcome data in CEA, while also being relatively easy to implement using freely available Bayesian software. This is a key advantage that can encourage practitioners to move away from likely biased methods and promote the use of our framework in routine analyses. In conclusion, the proposed framework can:\n\nJointly model costs and QALYs;\nAccount for skewness and structural values;\nAssess the robustness of the results under a set of differing missingness assumptions.\n\nThe original contribution of this work consists in the joint implementation of methods that account for the complexities of the data within a unique and flexible framework that is relatively easy to apply. In the next chapter we will take a step forward in the analysis and present a longitudinal model that can use all observed utility and cost data in the analysis, explore alternative nonignorable missing data assumptions, while simultaneously handling the complexities that affect the data."

In these studies, cost and effectiveness outcomes are commonly measured at multiple time points, but some observations may be missing. Restricting the analysis to the participants with complete data can lead to biased and inefficient estimates. Methods, such as multiple imputation, have been recommended as they make better use of the data available and are valid under less restrictive Missing At Random (MAR) assumption. Linear mixed effects models (LMMs) offer a simple alternative to handle missing data under MAR without requiring imputations, and have not been very well explored in the CEA context. In this manuscript, we aim to familiarise readers with LMMs and demonstrate their implementation in CEA. We illustrate the approach on a randomised trial of antidepressant, and provide the implementation code in R and Stata.

    "text": "Abstract\nPatient-level health economic data collected alongside clinical trials are an important component of the process of technology appraisal, with a view to informing resource allocation decisions. For end of life treatments, such as cancer treatments, modelling of cost-effectiveness/utility data may involve some form of partitioned survival analysis, where measures of health-related quality of life and survival time for both pre- and post-progression periods are combined to generate some aggregate measure of clinical benefits (e.g. quality-adjusted survival). In addition, resource use data are often collected from health records on different services from which different cost components are obtained (e.g. treatment, hospital or adverse events costs). A critical problem in these analyses is that both effectiveness and cost data present some complexities, including non-normality, spikes, and missingness, that should be addressed using appropriate methods. Bayesian modelling provides a powerful tool which has become more and more popular in the recent health economics and statistical literature to jointly handle these issues in a relatively easy way. This paper presents a general Bayesian framework that takes into account the complex relationships of trial-based partitioned survival cost-utility data, potentially providing a more adequate evidence for policymakers to inform the decision-making process.

    "title": "Bayesian Statistical Economic Evaluation Methods for Health Technology Assessment",
    "section": "",
    "text": "Abstract\nThe evidence produced by healthcare economic evaluation studies is a key component of any health technology assessment (HTA) process designed to inform resource allocation decisions in a budget limited context. To improve the quality (and harmonize the generation process) of such evidence, many HTA agencies have established methodological guidelines describing the normative framework inspiring their decision-making process. The information requirements that economic evaluation analyses for HTA must satisfy typically involve the use of complex quantitative syntheses of multiple available datasets, handling mixtures of aggregate and patient-level information, and the use of sophisticated statistical models for the analysis of non-Normal data (e.g. time-to-event, quality of life and costs). Much of the recent methodological research in economic evaluation for healthcare has developed in response to these needs, in terms of sound statistical decision-theoretic foundations, and is increasingly being formulated within a Bayesian paradigm. The rationale for this preference lies in the fact that by taking a probabilistic approach, based on decision rules and available information, a Bayesian economic evaluation study can explicitly account for relevant sources of uncertainty in the decision process and produce information to identify an optimal course of actions. Moreover, the Bayesian approach naturally allows the incorporation of an element of judgement or evidence from different sources (e.g.~expert opinion or multiple studies) into the analysis. This is particularly important when, as often occurs in economic evaluation for HTA, the evidence base is sparse and requires some inevitable mathematical modelling to bridge the gaps in the available data. The availability of free and open source software in the last two decades has greatly reduced the computational costs and facilitated the application of Bayesian methods and has the potential to improve the work of modellers and regulators alike, thus advancing the fields of economic evaluation of health care interventions. This chapter provides an overview of the areas where Bayesian methods have contributed to the address the methodological needs that stem from the normative framework adopted by a number of HTA agencies.\n\n\n\n\n\nCitationBibTeX citation:@online{gabrio2019,\n  author = {Gabrio, Andrea and Baio, Gianluca and Manca, Andrea},\n  title = {Bayesian {Statistical} {Economic} {Evaluation} {Methods} for\n    {Health} {Technology} {Assessment}},\n  date = {2019-06-01},\n  url = {https://oxfordre.com/economics/view/10.1093/acrefore/9780190625979.001.0001/acrefore-9780190625979-e-451},\n  doi = {10.1093/acrefore/9780190625979.013.451},\n  langid = {en},\n  abstract = {{[}The evidence produced by healthcare economic evaluation\n    studies is a key component of any health technology assessment (HTA)\n    process ...{]}\\{style=“font-size: 85\\%”\\}}\n}\nFor attribution, please cite this work as:\nGabrio, Andrea, Gianluca Baio, and Andrea Manca. 2019. “Bayesian\nStatistical Economic Evaluation Methods for Health Technology\nAssessment.” Oxford Research Encyclopedia of Economics and\nFinance, Oxford University Press.

    "title": "Handling Missing Data in Within-Trial Cost-Effectiveness Analysis: A Review with Future Recommendations",
    "section": "",
    "text": "Abstract\nCost-effectiveness analyses (CEAs) alongside randomised controlled trials (RCTs) are increasingly designed to collect resource use and preference-based health status data for the purpose of healthcare technology assessment. However, because of the way these measures are collected, they are prone to missing data, which can ultimately affect the decision of whether an intervention is good value for money. We examine how missing cost and effect outcome data are handled in RCT-based CEAs, complementing a previous review (covering 2003-2009, 88 articles) with a new systematic review (2009-2015, 81 articles) focussing on two different perspectives. First, we provide guidelines on how the information about missingness and related methods should be presented to improve the reporting and handling of missing data. We propose to address this issue by means of a quality evaluation scheme, providing a structured approach that can be used to guide the collection of information, elicitation of the assumptions, choice of methods and considerations of possible limitations of the given missingness problem. Second, we review the description of the missing data, the statistical methods used to deal with them and the quality of the judgement underpinning the choice of these methods. Our review shows that missing data in within-RCT CEAs are still often inadequately handled and the overall level of information provided to support the chosen methods is rarely satisfactory\n      \n\n\n\n\nCitationBibTeX citation:@online{gabrio2017,\n  author = {Gabrio, Andrea and J Mason, Alexina and Baio, Gianluca},\n  title = {Handling {Missing} {Data} in {Within-Trial}\n    {Cost-Effectiveness} {Analysis:} {A} {Review} with {Future}\n    {Recommendations}},\n  volume = {1},\n  number = {2},\n  date = {2017-06-01},\n  url = {https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s41669-017-0015-6},\n  doi = {10.1007/s41669-017-0015-6},\n  langid = {en},\n  abstract = {{[}Cost-effectiveness analyses (CEAs) alongside randomised\n    controlled trials (RCTs) are increasingly designed\n    ...{]}\\{style=“font-size: 85\\%”\\}}\n}\nFor attribution, please cite this work as:\nGabrio, Andrea, Alexina J Mason, and Gianluca Baio. 2017.\n“Handling Missing Data in Within-Trial Cost-Effectiveness\nAnalysis: A Review with Future Recommendations.”\nPharmacoeconomics-Open.

    "title": "Too many things, again….",
    "section": "",
    "text": "I did not have much time to post anything this month until now as it has been a quite busy period. I have been involved in many different works and I have also involved other people in what I think could be some very interesting new projects. Not that I complain about having many different things to do (most of them are actually cool) but doing everything in a short period is not the best.\nA couple of things have come/are coming up. First, I have seriously started working on the coding of a decision model for some health economic evaluation project I have been involved in since last year. Everything seems ok after I spent lots of days and time fixing some small bugs in my code. I am about half way through the model and I hope I will be able to finish it before Christmas (I doubt it though).\nSecond, I have finished reviewing an interesting paper about some new methods for improving current practice for dealing with missing data, which I kinda enjoy reading (very good!).\nThird, I would like to quickly summarise my first experience at ISPOR Europe in Copenhagen. I was really excited to attend this conference which, as expected, revealed itself as huge with people coming from all over the world and with many interesting sessions and discussion topics. I had the chance to meet new and old people, such as professor Andrea Manca and the always very kind Chris Sampson for whom I was like a stalker asking for more and more information about himself and his work. I also met some of my old collegues from MapiGroup, now under ICON plc. It was very fun to hang out with these old friends and see what they have been up to during this time. Among them, I gladly caught up with my dear friend Ryan Pulleyblank, now doing a PhD at the University of Southern Denmark. My poster was a success with (unexpectedly) many people stopping by and asking for more information on my work. I was genuinely surprised by this as ISPOR is mostly a conference dedicated to companies rather than academic works and networking. To sum up, it was a very nice and fun experience and despite the level of statistical methodology was not particularly high I enjoyed my time there and I also had the chance to visit Copenhagen for the first time.\nFinally, as a side note, I have found the time to upload on my arXiv page a nice application of Bayesian hierarchical models for the prediction of volleyball matches which I have been working on the past summer, taking inspiration from the work of Gianluca about predicting football macthes. I hope my work can turn out in something cool as well.\n\n\n\n\n\nThis is all for the moment but soon I will be heading back to another quite busy period for me. I hope this will be the last for some time, especially given that Christmas is coming and I would like to have some free time to properly enjoy this period, which I really like, even more than Christmas itself."

    "text": "I have got two news coming up. First, the paper I wrote with Michael and Gianluca on Bayesian methods for longitudinal data in trial-based economic evaluations has finally been published as early view on JRSSA. As I said in some earlier posts, I am super happy about this collaboration and I hope I can continue working on similar projects in the future.\nSecond, I will soon give a talk about this work at the ICTMC conference in Brighton, next Monday. This will be the first time at this conference and unfortunately I will only be able to remain around for one day as I need to go back to London pretty soon. I hope I will be able to enjoy my day at the conference, even though I will miss the talks of Baptiste and Alexina which are scheduled for the last day of the conference. I hope I can at least have a quick chat with them the day I am around.\n\n\n\n\n\nI am also excited to visit Brighton, since many people keep telling me that I should go and visit this sort of british version of “Rimini”. To be honest, I do not expect to find a nice weather, given that in this period it is raining a lot in London, but I hope I will be lucky and get the only sunny day of the week.\nFinally, I have started a rubric called missing data on my website, where I try to describe some of the most popular methods to handle missing data and to provide some references for anyone who could be interested in this field. I am really fascinated by statistical methods for dealing with missingness, perhaps because it was the main focus of my PhD, but I am eager to review different methods and see if I can find something really interesting. Of course, to complete this it will take more time, which I hope I will be able to find in the next months."

I already new this blog but I have never had a proper chance to read through its posts carefully, which is a shame.\n\n\n\n\n\nI shall promise myself to try to check it more often from now on, using this interview as a nice motivation to do so. In fact, there are not many blogs around health economics matters (here a non-comprehensive list), among which The Academic Health Economists and Gianluca’s blog are my favourites.\nI hope I will be able to find some time to write some nice posts about some health economic applications of my work in the next future as this is still the most interesting field for me at the moment."

    "title": "HESG Summer Meeting 2019",
    "section": "",
    "text": "I have just come back form my first Health Economists’ Study Group (HESG) meeting, which this year was held at the University of East Anglia in the beautiful city of Norwich, south east of England, and where I presented some preliminary results from one of my on-going works. I have to say, it was a remarkable experience which I really liked thanks to a wonderful and welcoming environment. I had the pleasure to talk to many people from different research areas involved in health economics (both from academia and industry) and to see many different projects and works.\nI particularly enjoy the structure of the meeting, which requires some chair and discussant who have to present and discuss the paper of the authors, who are only allowed to provide some clarification if needed. At first I thought this structure of the sessions was strange, but after attending many sessions and experiencing this for my own paper, I feel that it is a very good way to encourage discussion about works from different people rather than just focussing on your own presentation. Plus, the weather and always sunny, it felt like Italy for a few days.\n\n\n\nThe beautiful Norwich’s cathedral\n\n\nOther nice people and colleagues from HEART and other UCL department came to HESG with me, including Caroline and Ekaterina (aka Katia), you can see them in thumbnail of this post. I was also pleased to meet Baptiste from LSHTM, who shares with me the interest in missing data methods for cost-effectiveness analysis and who presented some very nice work on that. I had the chance to give some feedback to him and he did the same for me. It felt so nice when we started discussing about some aspects of our analyses and after some minutes we simply lost track of time and everyone else disappeared. I also had the opportunity to talk about my work with the discussant of my session, Catrin Plumpton from the Centre for Health Economics and Medicines Evaluation, who gave me some nice feedback which I really appreciated, especially given her mathematical background.\nAn important contribution to the success of the meeting was also given by the wonderful organisation of the event, including an accommodation located very closely to the main building of the meeting, plenty of food provided during each day, a nice bus tour of the city and a wonderful conference dinner. I must thank all the people, who organised the event who were very extremely nice to us and who were always ready to help us for whatever need we had, with a special mention for Emma Mcmanus who was amazing.\n\n\n\n\n\nIn summary, everything was good. Well, almost. Going back to the works presented, as usual, the only less positive note that I would like to make is the almost total absence of Bayesian applications. Some authors mentioned that they used some popular Bayesian program, such as WinBUGS, but this was mainly related to the usual meta-analysis stuff which is pretty standardised. I hope next time I will be able to see more people going Bayesian as this is what I am."

    "title": "The P value fallacy",
    "section": "",
    "text": "Today, I would like to briefly comment an interesting research article written by Goodman, who provided a clear and exemplary discussion about the typical incorrect interpretation of a standard frequentist analysis in the field of medical research. I will now briefly summarise the main argument of the paper and then add some personal comments.\nEssentially, the article describes the characteristics of the dominant school of medical statistics and highlights the logical fallacy at the heart of the typical frequentist analysis in clinical studies. This is based on a deductive inferential approach, which starts with a given hypothesis and makes conclusions under the assumption that the hypothesis is true. This is in contrast with a inductive approach, which uses the observed evidence to evaluate what hypothesis is most tenable. The two most popular methods of the frequentist paradigm are the P value proposed by Fisher and the hypothesis testing developed by Neyman and Pearson.\nThe P value is defined as the probability, under the assumption of no effect (null hypothesis), of obtaining a result equal to or more extreme than what was actually observed. Fisher proposed it as an informal index to be used as a measure of discrepancy between the data and the null hypothesis and therefore should not be interpreted as a formal inferential method. For example, since the P value can only be calculated on the assumption that the null hypothesis is true, it cannot be a direct measure of the probability that the null hypothesis is false. However, the main criticism to the P value is perhaps that it does not take into account the size of the observed effect, i.e. a small effect in a study with a large sample size can have the same P value as a large effect in a small study.\nHypothesis testing was proposed by Neyman and Pearson as an alternative approach to the P value, which assumes the existence of a null hypothesis (e.g. no effect) and an alternative hypothesis (e.g. nonzero effect). The outcome of the test is then simply to reject one hypothesis in favour of the other, solely based on the data. This exposes the researcher to two types of errors: type I error or false-positive (\\(\\alpha\\)) and type II error or false-negative (\\(\\beta\\)) result. Rather than focussing on single experiments, like the P value, hypothesis testing is effectively based on a deductive approach to minimise the errors over a large number of experiments. However, the price to pay to obtain this objectivity is the impossibility to make any inferential statement about a single experiment. The procedure only guarantees that in the long run, i.e. after considering many experiments, we shall not often be wrong.\nOver time a combination between the P value and hypothesis testing was developed under the assumption that the two approaches can be complementary. The idea was that the P value could be used to measure evidence in a single experiment while not violating the long run logic of hypothesis testing. The combined method is characterized by setting \\(\\alpha\\) and power \\(\\beta\\) before the experiment, then calculating a P value and rejecting the null hypothesis if the P value is less than the preset type I error rate. This means that the P value is considered a false-positive error rate specific to the data and also a measure of evidence against the null hypothesis. The P value fallacy is born from this statement, which assumes that an event can be seen simultaneously from a long run perspective (where the observed results are put together with other results that might have occurred in hypothetical repetitions of the experiment) and from a short run perspective (where the observed results are interpreted only with respect to the single experiment). However, these views are not reconcilable since a result cannot be at the same time an interchangeable (long-run) and unique (short-run) member of a group of results.\n\n\n\n\n\nI personally find this discussion fascinating and I believe that it is important to recognise the inconsistencies between the two alternative approaches to inference. The original authors of the two paradigms were well aware of the implications of their methods and never supported the combination of these. However, the combined approach has somehow become widely accepted in practice while its internal inconsistencies and conceptual limitations are hardly recognised.\nI feel that, since the two methods are perceived as “objective”, it is generally accepted that, if combined, they can produce reliable conclusions. This, however, is not necessarily true. Accepting at face value the significance result as a binary indicator of whether or not a relation is real is dangeroues and potentially misleading. This practice wants to show that conclusions are being drawn directly from the data, without any external influence, because direct inference from data to hypothesis is thought to result in mistaken conclusions only rarely and is therefore regarded as “scientific”.\nThis misguided approach has led to a much stronger emphasis towards the quantitative results alone (without any external input). In contrast, I believe that such perspective has the serious drawback of ignoring potentially useful information which is available (e.g. relevant medical knowledge or historical data) and which should be included in the analysis. Of course, I am aware of the potential issues that may arise from the selection and incorporation of external evidence, but I believe this should not be considered as “less reliable” or “more prone to mistakes” compared with the evidence from the available data. It is important that an agreement is reached about the selection of the type of evidence and methods to be used to perform the analysis solely based on their relevance with respect to the context analysed."

    "title": "MissingHE 1.2.1",
    "section": "",
    "text": "I have finally found some time to update the version for my R package missingHE, for which version 1.2.1 is now available on CRAN. I included two main features to the previous version of the package.\nFirst, I have added a new type of identifying restriction when fitting pattern mixture models through the function “pattern”. Before, only the complete case restriction was available, which identifies the distributions of the missing data with those from the completers. Now the alternative available case restriction is can also be selected, which relies on the distributions that can be identified among the non-completers to identify the distributions of the missing data. In this way, people can choose among at least two options for the type of restrictions and compare how this choice may affect the final estimates.\nSecond, I added a new accessory function called “ppc”, which allows to perform posterior predictive checks using the conditional parameters saved from the fitted model to generate replications of the data at each posterior iteration of the model. The function implements a relatively large number of checks, mostly taken from the R package bayesplot, which allow to assess the fit of the model to the observed data by type of outcome (effects and costs) and treatment group (control and intervention). For example, overalyed density plots can be generated to compare the empirical and replicated densities of the data to detect possible failures of the model.\n\n\n\nDensity plots for the observed and replicated data\n\n\nI feel this is very important as when fitting a Bayesian model it is crucial to assess whether the model seems to adequately capture the different characteristics of the observed data (e.g. skewness, structural values, etc.). A wide range of predictive checks are available, including histograms (see thumbnail pciture), scatterplots, error intervals, empirical cumulative distribution functions, statistics of interest and many others. In addition, these checks can be performed for each type of missingness model and parametric distribution chosen within missingHE.\n\n\n\n\n\nOf course, it is important to remember that, when dealing with missing data the fit of the model can only be checked with respect to the observed values and therefore this check is only partial since the fit to the unobserved values can never be checked. This is also why it is not meaningful to assess the fit of a model fitted under a missing not at random assumption because this is based on information which is not directly available from the data at hand and thus impossible to check."

    "text": "Finally the time of ISPOR Europe 2019 has arrived and I will depart in a few days for Copenhagen, where the conference is held this year. I am actually looking forward to this as I am curious to see what type of conference ISPOR is, that is, whether I will be able to find some interesting works and have some “applied statistics”-related discussions or the attention is more placed on “economics and clinical” matters. From what I heard by other people who routinely attend the conference, there should be a bit of both sides, even though I really hope I will be able to see some intersting methods and engage in discussion with some authors.\nI know the conference is mainly related to address the needs of pharmaceutical and consultancy companies, but I hope I will be able to see some familiar faces there. Well, to be honest I know that some people I already know are going, which is good considering that their work is really cool. As for me, I will present the same work that I showed at ICTMC 2019 (some slides available here), but this time in the format of a poster, of which I am kind of very proud in terms of the final output, if I may say so.\nApart from this nice event, there are many things coming up when I will be back from the conference, which I really need to start working on. Mostly, these are related to some routine work for some trial analyses at PRIMENT, which by the way is advertising a new health economist job vacancy for those who might be interested. Other tasks include writing down and code a decision model on which I have been working since ages, papers review, other collaborations with different people, starting my co-supervision for a new PhD student at stats and, after I can find some free time, do some research work on my beloved missing data. Am I ready? not sure about that …"

    "text": "After some nice holiday break, I came back to work ready for an exciting 2020 … or so I thought. Unfortunately, I have recently been caught by a terrible flu which forced me to postpone my flight back to London of a week. The worst part is that I was basically a dead corpse moving around with high fever and an awful condition for more than 4 days. It was quite a bad experience which I rarely had in my life. I am just glad I survived this.\n\n\n\n\n\nGoing back to more interesting news. Before my cursed period, I was smart enough to work on different things and I am happy to announce a new update for my missingHE package, which is available both on my GitHub page and on the CRAN repository. Its new version is 1.3.2 and has the nice addition of making available more choices for the parametric distributions that can be selected in all main functions of the package to handle missing data in trial-based economic evaluations. In particular, it is now possible to choose among new probability distributions for the health outcomes, including continuous (Gamma, Weibull, Exponential, Logistic), discrete (Poisson, Negative Binomial) and binary (Bernoulli) distributions. These may be useful when the analysis is not based on utilities scores but some other types of effects, such as survival time, number of events or binary outcomes. I have also included some examples for each type of outcome in the MenSS dataset (available directly once installed the package on your machine) so that people can play around with the new distributions.\nAnother good news is that the last paper written with Michael about missing data handling in economic evaluations will soon be published in the February issue of JRSSA, which will make the final and official version of the article that can be cited, I think.\nFinally, an announcement about the one-day course I am holding together with my mates from the HEART group about an introduction to economic evaluations to people who are not familiar with health economics. The course will take place next month, I believe on Feb 11th, in central London (soon an update about the exact location) and, as the previous edition, I am happy to see that all spots have been taken and everything is sold out (well, to be precise the course is free …). Need to meet up with the others to make the last changes and prepare the slides but I am quite excited about this, given also the good response we got last time.\nNow I am (hopefully) ready to start the new year and there are many things already piling up on my list of things to do in the next days. Let’s try again 2020."

    "text": "Abstract\nEconomic evaluations from individual level data are an important component of the process of technology appraisal, with a view to informing resource allocation decisions. A critical problem in these analyses is that both effectiveness and cost data typically present some complexity (eg, nonnormality, spikes, and missingness) that should be addressed using appropriate methods. However, in routine analyses, standardised approaches are typically used, possibly leading to biassed inferences. We present a general Bayesian framework that can handle the complexity. We show the benefits of using our approach with a motivating example, the MenSS trial, for which there are spikes at one in the effectiveness and missingness in both outcomes. We contrast a set of increasingly complex models and perform sensitivity analysis to assess the robustness of the conclusions to a range of plausible missingness assumptions. We demonstrate the flexibility of our approach with a second example, the PBS trial, and extend the framework to accommodate the characteristics of the data in this study.

    "text": "Abstract\nHealth economic evaluations based on patient-level data collected alongside clinical trials (e.g. health related quality of life and resource use measures) are an important component of the process which informs resource allocation decisions. Almost inevitably, the analysis is complicated by the fact that some individuals drop out from the study, which causes their data to be unobserved at some time point. Current practice performs the evaluation by handling the missing data at the level of aggregated variables (e.g. QALYs), which are obtained by combining the economic data over the duration of the study, and are often conducted under a missing at random (MAR) assumption. However, this approach may lead to incorrect inferences since it ignores the longitudinal nature of the data and may end up discarding a considerable amount of observations from the analysis. We propose the use of joint longitudinal models to extend standard cost-effectiveness analysis methods by taking into account the longitudinal structure and incorporate all available data to improve the estimation of the targeted quantities under MAR.

The purpose of this study is to review how missing multi-item questionnaire data are handled in trial-based CEAs. We searched the National Institute for Health Research journals to identify within-trial CEAs published between January 2016 and April 2021 using multi-item instruments to collect costs and quality of life (QOL) data. Information on missing data handling and methods, with a focus on the level and type of imputation, was extracted. A total of 87 trial-based CEAs were included in the review. Complete case analysis or available case analysis and multiple imputation (MI) were the most popular methods, selected by similar numbers of studies, to handle missing costs and QOL in base-case analysis. Nevertheless, complete case analysis or available case analysis dominated sensitivity analysis. Once imputation was chosen, missing costs were widely imputed at item-level via MI, whereas missing QOL was usually imputed at the more aggregated time point level during the follow-up via MI. Missing costs and QOL tend to be imputed at different levels of missingness in current CEAs alongside randomized controlled trials.

    "section": "",
    "text": "Introduction\nThe type of data used in economic evaluations typically come from a range of sources, whose evidence is combined to inform HTA decision-making. Traditionally, relative effectiveness data are derived from randomised controlled clinical trials (RCTs), while healthcare resource utilisation, costs and preference-based quality of life data may come from the same study that estimated the clinical effectiveness or not. A number of HTA agencies have developed their own methodological guidelines to support the generation of the evidence required to inform their decisions. In this context, the primary role of economic evaluation for HTA is not the estimation of the quantities of interest (e.g. the computation of point or interval estimation, or hypothesis testing), but to aid decision making. The implication of this is that the standard frequentist analyses that rely on power calculations and \\(P\\)-values to estimate statistical and clinical significance, typically used in RCTs, are not well-suited for addressing these HTA requirements.\nIt has been argued that, to be consistent with its intended role in HTA, economic evaluation should embrace a decision-theoretic paradigm and develop ideally within a Bayesian statistical framework to inform two decisions\n\nwhether the treatments under evaluation are cost-effective given the available evidence and\nwhether the level of uncertainty surrounding the decision is acceptable (i.e. the potential benefits are worth the costs of making the wrong decision).\n\nThis corresponds to quantify the impact of the uncertainty in the evidence on the entire decision-making process (e.g. to what extent the uncertainty in the estimation of the effectiveness of a new intervention affects the decision about whether it is paid for by the public provider).\n\n\nBayesian methods in HTA\nThere are several reasons that make the use of Bayesian methods in economic evaluations particularly appealing. First, Bayesian modelling is naturally embedded in the wider scheme of decision theory; by taking a probabilistic approach, based on decision rules and available information, it is possible to explicitly account for relevant sources of uncertainty in the decision process and obtain an optimal course of action. Second, Bayesian methods allow extreme flexibility in modelling using computational algorithms such as Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) methods; this allows to handle in a relatively easy way the generally sophisticated structure of the relationships and complexities that characterise effectiveness, quality of life and cost data. Third, through the use of prior distributions, the Bayesian approach naturally allows the incorporation of evidence from different sources in the analysis (e.g. expert opinion or multiple studies), which may improve the estimation of the quantities of interest; the process is generally referred to as evidence synthesis and finds its most common application in the use of meta-analytic tools. This may be extremely important when, as it often happens, there is only some partial (imperfect) information to identify the model parameters. In this case analysts are required to develop chain-of-evidence models. When required by the limitations in the evidence base, subjective prior distributions can be specified based on the synthesis and elicitation of expert opinion to identify the model, and their impact on the results can be assessed by presenting or combining the results across a range of plausible alternatives. Finally, under a Bayesian approach, it is straightforward to conduct sensitivity analysis to properly account for the impact of uncertainty in all inputs of the decision process; this is a required component in the approval or reimbursement of a new intervention for many decision-making bodies, such as NICE in the UK.\nThe general process of conducting a Bayesian analysis (with a view of using the results of the model to perform an economic evaluation) can be broken down in several steps, which are graphically summarized in Figure 1.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1: Diagram representation of the process for health economic evaluation.\n\n\n\nThe starting point is the identification of the decision problem, which defines the objective of the economic evaluation (e.g. the interventions being compared, the target population, the relevant time horizon). In line with the decision problem, a statistical model is constructed to describe the (by necessity, limited) knowledge of the underlying clinical pathways. This implies, for example, the definition of suitable models to describe variability in potentially observed data (e.g. the number of patients recovering from the disease because of a given treatment), as well as the epistemic uncertainty in the population parameters (e.g. the underlying probability that a random individual in the target population is cured, if given the treatment under study). At this point, all the relevant data are identified, collected and quantitatively sytnthesised to derive the estimates of the input parameters of interest for the model.\nThese parameter estimates (and associated uncertainties) are then fed to the economic model, with the objective of obtaining some relevant summaries indicating the benefits and costs for each intervention under evaluation. Uncertainty analysis represents some sort of detour from the straight path going from the statistical model to the decision analysis: if the output of the statistical model allowed us to know with perfect certainty the true value of the model parameters, then it would be possible to simply run the decision analysis and make the decision. Of course, even if the statistical model were the true representation of the underlying data generating process (which it most certainly is not), because the data may be limited in terms of length of follow up, or sample size, the uncertainty in the value of the model parameters would still remain. This parameter (and structural) uncertainty is propagated throughout the whole process to evaluate its impact on the decision-making. In some cases, although there might be substantial uncertainty in the model inputs, this may not turn out to modify substantially the output of the decision analysis, i.e. the new treatment would be deemed as optimal irrespectively. In other cases, however, even a small amount of uncertainty in the inputs could be associated with very serious consequences. In such circumstances, the decision-maker may conclude that the available evidence is not sufficient to decide on which intervention to select and require more information before a decision can be made.\nThe results of the above analysis can be used to inform policy makers about two related decisions:\n\nwhether the new intervention is to be considered (on average) value for money, given the evidence base available at the time of decision, and\nwhether the consequences (in terms of net health loss) of making the wrong decision would warrant further research to reduce this decision uncertaint.\n\nWhile the type and specification of the statistical and economic models vary with the nature of the underlying data (e.g. individual (ILD) level versus aggregated (ALD) data, the decision and uncertainty analyses have a more standardised set up.\n\n\nConclusions\nHTA has been slow to adopt Bayesian methods; this could be due to a reluctance to use prior opinions, unfamiliarity, mathematical complexity, lack of software, or conservatism of the healthcare establishment and, in particular, the regulatory authorities. However, the use of Bayesian approach has been increasingly advocated as an efficient tool to integrate statistical evidence synthesis and parameter estimation with probabilistic decision analysis in an unified framework for HTA. This enables a transparent evidence-based decision modelling, reflecting the uncertainty and the structural relationships in all the available data.\nWith respect to trial-based analyses, the flexibility and modularity of the Bayesian modelling structure are well-suited to jointly account for the typical complexities that affect ILD. In addition, prior distributions can be used as convenient means to incorporate external information into the model when the evidence from the data is limited or absent (e.g. for missing values). In the context of evidence synthesis, the Bayesian approach is particularly appealing in that it allows for all the uncertainty and correlation induced by the often heterogeneous nature of the evidence (either ALD only or both ALD and ILD) to be synthesised in a way that can be easily integrated within a decision modelling framework.\nThe availability and spread of Bayesian software among practitioners since the late 1990s, such as OpenBUGS or JAGS, has greatly improved the applicability and reduced the computational costs of these models. Thus, analysts are provided with a powerful framework, which has been termed comprehensive decision modelling, for simultaneously estimating posterior distributions for parameters based on specified prior knowledge and data evidence, and for translating this into the ultimate measures used in the decision analysis to inform cost-effectiveness conclusions."

    "text": "Introduction\nIn trial-based economic evaluation, some individuals are typically associated with missing data at some time point, so that their corresponding aggregated outcomes (e.g. quality-adjusted life-years) cannot be evaluated. Restricting the analysis to the complete cases is inefficient and can result in biased estimates, while imputation methods are often implemented under a missing at random (MAR) assumption. We propose the use of joint longitudinal models to extend standard approaches by taking into account the longitudinal structure to improve the estimation of the targeted quantities under MAR.\n\n\nStandard approach in trial-based CEA\nAccording to recent reviews, standard practice in trial-based CEAs handles missingness at the level of the aggregated outcomes and baseline variables. Indeed, estimates of interest are obtained by directly modeling the aggregated outcomes rather than the utility and cost data at each time. This requires the analyst to process the data collected on individual \\(i\\) at time \\(j\\) in treatment \\(t\\), to derive the aggregated measures over the study duration.\nFigure 1 shows a typical data set of trial-based CEA, formed by the sets of utility and cost variables collected at baseline \\(j = 0\\) and some follow-ups \\(j = 1,\\ldots,J\\). The graph represents the standard procedure for processing the data and identifying the variables used in the analysis.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1: Schematic representation of the standard procedure for processing trial-based CEA data\n\n\n\nA general limitation of any aggregated method is to ignore the longitudinal nature of the data and discard all follow-up values for partially observed individuals. Conversely, methods that handle missingness at each time point account for the longitudinal structure, incorporate all available evidence, and potentially make the missingness assumptions (e.g. missing at random or MAR) more reasonable.\n\n\nMethods\nWe propose the use of joint longitudinal models to extend standard approaches by taking into account the longitudinal structure to improve the estimation of the targeted quantities under MAR. We compare the results from methods that handle missingness at an aggregated (case deletion, baseline imputation, and joint aggregated models) and disaggregated (joint longitudinal models) level under MAR. The methods are compared using a simulation study and applied to data from 2 real case studies.\n\n\nConclusions\nJoint longitudinal models provide an alternative and potentially less biased approach for handling missing data with respect to current practice under a missing at random assumption. Methods that ignore some of the available information may be associated with biased results and mislead the decision-making process. This is a potentially serious issue for those who use these evaluations in their decision making, thus possibly leading to incorrect policy decisions about the cost-effectiveness of new treatment options."

Assume that the primary endpoint of the trial is OS, while secondary endpoints include PFS, a self-reported health-related quality of life questionnaire (e.g. EQ-5D) and health records on different types of services (e.g. drug frequency and dosage, hospital visits, etc.). Following standard health economic notation, we denote with \\(\\boldsymbol e_{it}\\) and \\(\\boldsymbol c_{it}\\) the two sets of health economic outcomes (effectiveness and costs) collected for the \\(i\\)-th individual in treatment \\(t\\) of the trial. For simplicity, we define \\(\\boldsymbol e_{it}\\) and \\(\\boldsymbol c_{it}\\) based on the variables used in the analysis.\nThe effectiveness outcomes are represented by pre-progression (\\(e^{PFS}\\_{it}=\\text{QAS}^{\\text{PFS}}\\)) and post-progression (\\(e^{PPS}\\_{it}=\\text{QAS}^{\\text{PPS}}\\)) QAS data calculated using survival and utility data collected up to and beyond progression. We denote the full set of effectiveness variables as \\(\\boldsymbol e_{it}=(e^{\\text{PFS}}\\_{it},e^{\\text{PPS}}\\_{it})\\), formed by the pre and post-progression components. The cost outcomes are represented by a set of \\(K\\) variables (\\(c\\_{it}=c^k\\_{it}\\), for \\(k=1,\\ldots,K\\)) calculated based on \\(K\\) different types of health services and associated unit prices. We denote the full set of cost variables as \\(\\boldsymbol c\\_{it}=(c^1\\_{it},\\ldots,c^K\\_{it})\\), formed by the \\(K\\) different cost components.\nThe objective of the economic evaluation is to perform a patient-level partitioned survival cost-utility analysis by specifying a joint model \\(p\\boldsymbol e\\_{it}, \\boldsymbol c\\_{it} \\mid \\boldsymbol \\theta)\\), where \\(\\boldsymbol \\theta\\) denotes the full set of model parameters. Among these parameters, interest is in the marginal mean effectiveness and costs \\(\\boldsymbol \\mu=(\\mu\\_{et},\\mu\\_{ct})\\) which are used to inform the decision-making process. Different approaches can be used to specify \\(p\\boldsymbol e\\_{it}, \\boldsymbol c\\_{it} \\mid \\boldsymbol \\theta)\\). Here, we express the joint distribution as\n\\[\np(\\boldsymbol e_{it}, \\boldsymbol c_{it} \\mid \\boldsymbol \\theta) = p(\\boldsymbol e_{it} \\mid \\boldsymbol \\theta_e)p(\\boldsymbol c_{it} \\mid \\boldsymbol  e_{it} , \\boldsymbol  \\theta_c),\n\\tag{1}\\]\nwhere \\(p(\\boldsymbol e_{it} \\mid \\boldsymbol  \\theta_e)\\) is the marginal distribution of the effectiveness and \\(p(\\boldsymbol  c_{it} \\mid \\boldsymbol  e_{it} \\boldsymbol  \\theta_c)\\) is the conditional distribution of the costs given the effectiveness, respectively indexed by \\(\\boldsymbol  \\theta_e\\) and \\(\\boldsymbol  \\theta_c\\), with \\(\\boldsymbol  \\theta=(\\boldsymbol  \\theta_e,\\boldsymbol  \\theta_c)\\). We specify the model in Equation 1 in terms of a marginal distribution for the effectiveness and a conditional distribution for the costs. A key advantage of using a conditional factorisation, compared to a multivariate marginal approach, is that univariate models for each variable can be flexibly specified to tackle the idiosyncrasies of the data (e.g. non-normality ans spikes) while also capturing the potential correlation between the variables. We now describe how the two factors on the right-hand side of the Equation can be specified.\nFigure 1 provides a visual representation of the proposed modelling framework.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1: Visual representation of the proposed modelling framework\n\n\n\nThe effectiveness and cost distributions are represented in terms of combined “modules”- the red and blue boxes - in which the random quantities are linked through logical relationships. Notably, this is general enough to be extended to any suitable distributional assumption, as well as to handle covariates in each module.\n\n\nConclusions\nAlthough our approach may not be applicable to all cases, the data analysed are very much representative of the “typical” data used in partitioned survival cost-utility analysis alongside clinical trials. Thus, it is highly likely that the same features apply to other real cases. This is a very important, if somewhat overlooked problem, as methods that do not take into account the complexities affecting patient-level data, while being easier to implement and well established among practitioners, may ultimately mislead cost-effectiveness conclusions and bias the decision-making process."

    "text": "We performed a systematic literature review that assesses the quality of the information reported and type of methods used to handle missing outcome data in trial-based economic evaluations. The purpose of this review is to critically appraise the current literature in within-trial CEAs with respect to the quality of the information reported and the methods used to deal with missingness for both effectiveness and costs. The review complements previous work, covering 2003-2009 (88 articles) with a new systematic review, covering 2009-2015 (81 articles) and focuses on two perspectives.\nFirst, we provide guidelines on how the information about missingness and related methods should be presented to improve the reporting and handling of missing data. We propose to address this issue by means of a Quality Evaluation Scheme (QES), providing a structured approach that can be used to guide the collection of information, formulation of the assumptions, choice of methods, and considerations of possible limitations for the given missingness problem. Second, we review the description of the missing data, the statistical methods used to deal with them and the quality of the judgement underpinning the choice of these methods."

    "text": "Descriptive Review\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2: Missingness methods by outcome and period.\n\n\n\nFrom the comparison of the base-case methods used for the costs and effects between 2009 and 2015, the Figure above shows a marked reduction in the number of methods not clearly described for the effects, compared to those for the costs. A possible reason for this is that, while clinical effectiveness measures are often collected through self-reported questionnaires, which are naturally prone to missingness, cost measures rely more on clinical patient files which may ensure a higher completeness rate. It was not possible to confirm this interpretation in the reviewed studies due to the high proportions of articles not clearly reporting the missing rates in both 2003-2009 and 2009-2015 periods, for effects (\\(\\approx 45\\%\\) and \\(\\approx 38\\%\\)) and costs ( \\(\\approx 50\\%\\) and \\(\\approx 62\\%\\)). In addition, clinical outcomes are almost invariably the main objective of RCTs and are usually subject to more advanced and standardised analyses. Arguably, costs are often considered as an add-on to the standard trial: for instance, sample size calculations are almost always performed with the effectiveness measure as the only outcome of interest. Consequently, missing data methods are less frequently well thought through for the analysis of the costs. However, this situation is likely to change as cost data from different perspectives (e.g. caregivers, patients, society, etc.) are being increasingly used in trials, leading to the more frequent adoption of self-report cost data which may start to exhibit similar missingness characteristics to effect data.\nThe review identified only a few articles using more than one alternative method. In addition, these analyses are typically conducted without any clear justification about their underlying missing data assumptions and may therefore not provide a concrete assessment of the impact of missingness uncertainty. This situation indicates a gap in the literature associated with an under-implementation of sensitivity analysis, which may significantly affect the whole decision-making process outcome, under the perspective of a body who is responsible for providing recommendations about the implementation of alternative interventions for health care matters.\nLimiting the assessment of missingness assumptions to a single case is unlikely to provide a reliable picture of the underlying mechanism. This, in turn, may have a significant impact on the CEA and mislead its conclusions, suggesting the implementation of non-cost-effective treatments. Robustness analyses assess the sensitivity of the results to alternative missing data methods but do not justify the choice of these methods and their underlying assumptions about missingness which may therefore be inappropriate in the specific context analysed. By contrast, sensitivity analyses, which rely on external information to explore plausible alternative methods and missingness assumptions, represent an important and more appropriate tool to provide realistic assessments of the impact of missing data uncertainty on the final conclusions."

    "text": "Quality assessment\nGenerally speaking, most of the reviewed papers achieved an unsatisfactory quality score under the QES. Indeed, the benchmark area on the top-right corner of the graphs is barely reached by less than \\(7\\%\\) of the articles, both for cost and effect data.\nOverall, the proportions of the studies associated with the lowest category (E) prevails in the majority of the years, with a similar pattern over time between missing costs and effects. All the articles that are associated with the top category (A) belong to the period 2013-2015, with the highest proportions of articles falling in this category being observed in 2015 for both outcomes. The opportunity of reaching such a target might be precluded by the choice of the method adopted, which may not be able to support less restrictive assumptions about missingness, even when this would be desirable. As a result, when simple methods cannot be fully justified it is necessary to replace them with more flexible ones that can relax assumptions and incorporate more alternatives. In settings such as those involving MNAR, sensitivity analysis might represent the only possible approach to account for the uncertainty due to the missingness in a principled way. However, due to the lack of studies either performing a sensitivity analysis or providing high quality scores on the assumptions, missingness is not adequately addressed in most studies. This could have the serious consequence of imposing too restrictive assumptions about missingness and affect the outcome of decision making."

    "text": "missingHE is a R package aimed at providing some useful tools to analysts in order to handle missing outcome data under a Full Bayesian framework in economic evaluations. The package relies on the R package R2jags to implement Bayesian methods via the statistical software JAGS. The package allows to obtain inferences using Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) methods under a range of modelling approaches and missing data assumptions. The package also contains functions specifically defined to assess model fit and possible issues in model convergence as well as to summarise the main results from the economic analysis.\nMissing data are iteratively imputed using data augmentation methods according to the type of model, distribution and missingness assumptions specified by the user using different arguments in the functions of the package. The posterior distribution of the main quantities of interest (e.g. some suitable measures of costs and clinical benefits) is then summarised to assess the cost-effectiveness of a new intervention (\\(t=2\\)) against a standard intervention (\\(t=1\\)).\nmissingHE produces plots which compares the observed and imputed values for both cost and benefit measures in each treatment intervention considered to detect possible concerns about the plausibility of the imputation methods. In addition, the output of missingHE cab be analysed using different funtions in the R package BCEA which produces a synthesis of the decision process given the current evidence and uncertainty, as well as several indicators that can be used to perform Probabilistic Sensitivity Analysis to parameter and model uncertainty.\n\n\n\nExample of a graphical output from missingHE"

    "text": "News and updates about missingHE\n\nFrom 25/09/2019, the updated version (1.2.1) of missingHE has become available on CRAN, which allows to perform posterior predictive checks for each type of model as a further way to assess the fit of the model to the observed data.\n\nThe checks can be done by first setting the optional argument ppc = TRUE when fitting the model using one of the main function of the package. For example, when using selection to fit selection models you would have something like this:\nThen you can use the function ppc to perform different types of posterior predictive checks that you can choose among a set of pre-specified types using the type argument. For example, if we want to compare histograms of the empirical and predictive distributions of the effectiveness variable in one arm (e.g. control), then we can type\nand we get something like this\n\n\n\nExample of posterior predictive checks in missingHE\n\n\n\nFrom 07/01/2020, the updated version (1.3.2) of missingHE has become available on CRAN, which allows to choose among more distributions for the effectiveness measures, including continuous (Gamma, Weibull, Exponential, Logistic), discrete (Poisson, Negative Binomial) and binary (Bernoulli) health outcomes.\n\nFor example, we can choose to specify a selection model assuming a Bernoulli distribution for the effects (if this is a binary outcome) and a LogNormal distribution for the costs\n\nFrom 30/04/2020, the updated version (1.4.0) of missingHE has become available on CRAN, which allows to perform fit random effects for each type of model implemented. The random terms can be specified using the following notation\n\nI borrowed this notation, alongside with a couple of internal functions, from the lme4 package. The terms inside the brackets on the left of the bar are the terms for which the random effects are assumed (these must also be included as fixed effects). The term on the right of the bar is the clustering variable over which the random effects are specified.\nFor example the formula + (age | site) specifies random effects for the intercept and age across the values of the site variable. It aslo possible to specify random slope only models (i.e. remove the random intercept) by adding the term 0 + inside the brackets on the left of the bar.\nAll functions in the package have been updated to take into account the possibility that random effects are specified and to perform diagnostic and posterior predictive checks based on the random effects if these are included. In addition, a new generic function called coef is now available to extract the fixed or random effect terms from the effectiveness and cost models for each type of model in missingHE. For example, we can extract summary statistics for the fixed effects from the fitted selection model by using the command\nwhich prints something like this\nIf we set random = TRUE, then summary statistics for the random effects terms are printed.\n\nFrom 10/06/2020 a new version (1.4.1) of missingHE is available to download from my GitHub page, which includes three vignettes providing some tutorials on how to use the functions of the package. Each vignette is specifically designed to help different types of users:\n\nThe first vignette is named Introduction_to_missingHE and is designed to provide some introductory summary about the use of the functions of the package based on the default settings, what the user needs to specify and how to interpret and extract the results. See the vignette here\nThe second vignette is named Fitting_MNAR_models_in_missingHE and is deisgned to help those who would like to explore MNAR assumptions and how this can be done within each main function of the package. See the vignette here\nThe third vignette is named Model_customisation_in_missingHE and is designed for those who are already familiar with the package but who would like to customise the functions in a more flexible way, for example by including random effects, using different priors or modelling assumptions. See the vignette here\n\nFrom 21/03/2023 a new version (4.2.0) of missingHE is available to download from my GitHub page, which includes an additional vignette providing some tutorials on how to extend the already existing functions within the package to fit longitudinal data. Some functions and options still need to be updated but the default configurations for either selection, pattern, or hurdle functions can now be applied to two-arms within-trial longitudinal data economic evaluations. See the vignette here\n\nMore information, including new updates, about missingHE can be found on my dedicated GitHub repository or via the most up to date version of the package on CRAN."
