    "text": "We extend and adapt the modelling frameworks typically used for the analysis of football data and propose a novel Bayesian hierarchical modelling framework for the analysis and prediction of volleyball results in regular seasons. Three different sub-models or “modules” form our framework: (1) The module of the observed number of points scored by the two opposing teams in a match (\\(y_h\\) and \\(y_a\\)); (2) the module of the binary indicator for the number of sets played (\\(d^s\\)); (3) the module of the binary indicator for the winner of the match (\\(d^m\\)). These three modules are jointly modelled using a flexible Bayesian parametric approach, which allows to fully propagate the uncertainty for each unobserved quantity and to assess the predictive performance of the model in a relatively easy way. In the following, we describe the notation and the model used in each of the three modules.\n\n\nIn the first module of the framework, we model the number of points scored by the home and away team in the \\(i\\)-th match of the season \\(\\boldsymbol y=(y_{hi},y_{ai})\\) using two independent Poisson distributions, as shown in Equation 1 and Equation 2:\n\\[\ny_{hi} \\sim Poisson(\\theta_{hi}),\n\\tag{1}\\]\n\\[\ny_{ai} \\sim Poisson(\\theta_{ai}),\n\\tag{2}\\]\nconditionally on the set of parameters \\(\\boldsymbol \\theta=(\\theta_{hi},\\theta_{ai})\\), representing the scoring intensity in the \\(i\\)-th match for the home and away team, respectively. These parameters are then modelled using the log-linear regressions, as shown in Equation 3 and Equation 4:\n\\[\nlog(\\theta_{hi}) =\\mu + \\lambda + att_{h(i)} + def_{a(i)},\n\\tag{3}\\]\n\\[\nlog(\\theta_{ai}) =\\mu + att_{a(i)} + def_{h(i)},\n\\tag{4}\\]\nwhich corresponds to a Poisson log-linear model. Within these formulae, \\(\\mu\\) is a constant, while \\(\\lambda\\) can be identified as the home effect and represents the advantage for the team hosting the game which is typically assumed to be constant for all the teams and throughout the season. The overall offensive and defensive performances of the \\(k\\)-th team is captured by the parameters \\(att\\) and \\(def\\), whose nested indexes \\(h(i), a(i)=1,\\ldots,K\\) identify the home and away team in the \\(i\\)-th game of the season, where \\(K\\) denotes the total number of the teams.\nWe then expand the modelling framework to incorporate match-specific statistics related to the offensive and defensive performances of the home and away teams. More specifically, Equation 5 and Equation 6 show the effects associated with the attack intensity of the home teams and the defence effect of the away teams:\n\\[\natt_{h(i)} =\\alpha_{0h(i)} + \\alpha_{1h(i)}att^{eff}_{hi} + \\alpha_{2h(i)}ser^{eff}_{hi},\n\\tag{5}\\]\n\\[\ndef_{a(i)} =\\beta_{0a(i)} + \\beta_{1a(i)}def^{eff}_{ai} + \\beta_{2a(i)}blo^{eff}_{ai}.\n\\tag{6}\\]\nWe omit the index \\(i\\) from the terms to the left-hand side of the above formulae to ease notation, i.e. \\(att_{h(i)}=att_{h(i)i}\\) and \\(def_{a(i)}=def_{a(i)i}\\). The overall offensive effect of the home teams is a function of a baseline team specific parameter \\(\\alpha_{0h(i)}\\), and the attack and serve efficiencies of the home team, whose impact is captured by the parameters \\(\\alpha_{1h(i)}\\) and \\(\\alpha_{2h(i)}\\). The overall defensive effect of the away team is a function of a baseline team-specific parameter \\(\\beta_{0a(i)}\\), and the defence and block efficiencies of the away team, whose impact is captured by the parameters \\(\\beta_{1a(i)}\\) and \\(\\beta_{2a(i)}\\), respectively. Similarly, Equation 7 and Equation 8 show the effects associated with the attack intensity of the away teams and the defence effect of the home teams:\n\\[\natt_{a(i)} =\\alpha_{0a(i)} + \\alpha_{1a(i)}att^{eff}_{ai}+ \\alpha_{2a(i)}ser^{eff}_{ai},\n\\tag{7}\\]\n\\[\ndef_{h(i)} =\\beta_{0h(i)} + \\beta_{1h(i)}def^{eff}_{hi}+ \\beta_{2h(i)}blo^{eff}_{hi},\n\\tag{8}\\]\nTo achieve identifiability of the model, a set of parametric constraints needs to be imposed. We impose sum-to-zero constraints on the team-specific parameters, i.e. we set \\(\\sum_{k=1}^{K}\\alpha_{jk}=0\\) and \\(\\sum_{k=1}^{K}\\beta_{jk}=0\\), for \\(k=1,\\ldots,K\\) and \\(j=(0,1,2)\\). Under this set of constraints, the overall offensive and defensive effects of the teams are expressed as departures from a team of average offensive and defensive performance. Within a Bayesian framework, prior distributions need to be specified for all random parameters in the model. Weakly informative Normal distributions centred at \\(0\\) with a relatively large variances are specified for the fixed effect parameters.\n\n\n\nIn the second module, we explicitly model the chance of playing \\(5\\) sets in the \\(i\\)-th match of the season, i.e. the sum of the sets won by the home (\\(s_{hi}\\)) and away (\\(s_{ai}\\)) team is equal to \\(5\\). This is necessary when generating predictions in order to correctly assign the points to the winning/losing teams throughout the season and evaluate the rankings of the teams at the end of the season. We model the indicator variable \\(d^s_{i}\\), taking value \\(1\\) if \\(5\\) sets were played in the \\(i-\\)th match and \\(0\\) otherwise, as shown in Equation 9 and Equation 10, using a Bernoulli distribution\n\\[\nd^s_{i}:=\\mathbb{I}(s_{hi}+s_{ai}=5)\\sim\\mbox{Bernoulli}(\\pi^s_{i}),\n\\tag{9}\\]\nwhere\n\\[\nlogit(\\pi^s_{i})= \\gamma_0 + \\gamma_1y_{hi} + \\gamma_2y_{ai}.  \n\\tag{10}\\]\n\n\n\nThe last module deals with the chance of the home team to win the \\(i\\)-th match, i.e. the total number of sets won by the home team (\\(s_{hi}\\)) is larger than that of the away team (\\(s_{ai}\\)) – we note that we could have also equivalently decided to model the chance of the away team to win the \\(i\\)-th match. This part of the model is again necessary when predicting the results for future matches, since the team associated with the higher number of points scored in the \\(i\\)-th match may not correspond to the winning team. We model the indicator variable \\(d^m_{i}\\), taking value \\(1\\) if the home team won the \\(i-\\)th match and \\(0\\) otherwise, as shown in Equation 11 and Equation 12, using another Bernoulli distribution\n\\[\nd^m_{i}:=\\mathbb{I}(s_{hi}&gt;s_{ai}) \\sim\\mbox{Bernoulli}(\\pi^m_{i}),\n\\tag{11}\\]\nwhere\n\\[\nlogit(\\pi^m_{i})= \\eta_0 + \\eta_1y_{hi} + \\eta_2y_{ai} + \\eta_3 d^s_i.\n\\tag{12}\\]\nFigure 1 shows a graphical representation of the modelling framework proposed.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1: Graphical representation of the modelling framework.\n\n\n\nThe framework corresponds to a joint distribution for all the observed quantities which are explicitly modelled. This is factored into the product of the marginal distribution of the total number of points scored by the two teams in each match, Module 1 – \\(p(\\boldsymbol y)\\), the conditional distribution of the probability of playing \\(5\\) sets in a match given \\(\\boldsymbol y\\), Module 2 – \\(p(d^s_i \\mid \\boldsymbol y)\\), and the conditional probability of winning the match given \\(\\boldsymbol y\\) and \\(d^s_i\\), Module 3 – \\(p(d^m_i\\mid \\boldsymbol y, d^s_i)\\). Module 1 also includes the different in-game statistics as covariates in the model. These are related to the either the offensive (serve and attack efficiency) or defensive (defence and block efficiency) effects of the home and away teams in each match of the season, and are respectively denoted in the graph as \\(\\boldsymbol x^{att}_{ti}=(ser^{eff}_{ti}, att^{eff}_{ti})\\) and \\(\\boldsymbol x^{def}_{ti}=(def^{eff}_{ti}, blo^{eff}_{ti})\\) to ease notation, for \\(t=(h,a)\\).\n\n\n\nAlthough the individual-level correlation between the observable variables \\(y_{hi}\\) and \\(y_{ai}\\) is taken into account through the hierarchical structure of the framework, a potential limitation of the model is that it ignores the possible multilevel correlation between the team-specific offensive \\(\\alpha_{jk}\\) and defensive \\(\\beta_{jk}\\) coefficients, for \\(j=(0,1,2)\\) and \\(k=1,\\ldots,K\\). In an alternative analysis, we account for the multilevel correlation using Inverse-Wishart distributions on the covariance matrix of the team specific parameters $ {}$ and $ {}$, which are scaled in order to facilitate the specification of the priors."

    "title": "A review of heath economic evaluation practice in the Netherlands: are we moving forward?",
    "section": "",
    "text": "Introduction\nIn the Netherlands, the Dutch National Health Care Institute (Zorginstituut Nederland or ZIN) is the body in charge of issuing recommendations and guidance on good practice in health economic evaluations, not just for pharmaceutical products, but also in relation to other fields of application such as medical devices, long-term care and forensics. In 2016, ZIN issued an update on the guidance for health economic evaluations, which aggregated into a single document and revised three separately published guidelines for pharmacoeconomics evaluation, outcomes research and costing manual. The novel aspects and future policy direction introduced by these guidelines have already been object of discussion, particularly with respect to the potential impact and concerns associated with their implementation in standard health economics practice in the Netherlands. Given the importance covered by these guidelines, an assessment of their impact on economic evaluation practice is desirable.\nThe objective of this paper was to review the evolution of health economic evaluation practice in the Netherlands before and after the introduction of the ZIN’s 2016 guidelines. Based on some key components within the health economics framework addressed by the new guidelines, we specifically focus on reviewing the statistical methods, missing data methods and software implemented by health economists. Given the intrinsic complexity of analysing health economics data, the choice of the analytical approaches to deal with these problems as well as transparent information on their implementation is crucial in determining the degree of confidence that decision-makers should have towards cost-effectiveness results obtained from these studies\n\n\nThe ZIN 2016 guidelines\nThe main objective of the guidelines is to ensure the comparability and quality of health economic evaluations in the Netherlands, therefore facilitating the task of the decision-maker regarding the reimbursement of new health care interventions. Following the example of guidelines issued by decision-making bodies in other countries, including the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) in the UK, the recommended features for economic evaluations are summarised in a typical scenario referred to as ‘reference case’, although deviations from it are allowed when properly justified.\nBased on the structure of the reference case, four essential components of a health economic evaluation are identified: framework, analytic approach, input data and reporting. For the purpose of the review, we only focus on these components in the reference case as the main elements upon which evaluating health economics practice.\n\n\nMethods\nWe performed a bibliographic search in June 2021 using search engines of two online full-text journal repositories: (1) PubMed and (2) Zorginstituut. These sources were chosen to maximise the number of studies that could be accessed given the scoping nature of the review and the lack of a search strategy based on a pre-defined and rigid approach typical of systematic reviews. Articles were considered eligible for the review only if they were cost-effectiveness or cost-utility analyses targeting a Dutch population. To allow the inclusion of a reasonable amount of studies, the key words used in the search strategy were (cost-effectiveness OR cost-utility OR economic evaluation), and we targeted studies published between January 2016 and April 2021.\n\n\nAnalytic approaches\nAlmost all reviewed empirical analyses used bootstrapping (95%), although the number of replications varied largely across the studies, with the most popular choices being 5000 (55%) followed by 2000 (29%). Studies showed even more variability in the choice of the methods used in combination with bootstrapping. Seven general classes of statistical approaches were identified, among which unadjusted methods were the most popular choice across both time periods. A clear change in the type of statistical methods used between the two periods is denoted by a strong decrease (from 64 to 39) in the number of unadjusted analyses in 2016–2020 compared to the earlier period, which is compensated by a rise in the number of adjusted analyses using either SUR or linear mixed effects model (LMM) methods.\nFrom Figure 1 we can look at the different type and combination of software programs used as an indication of the implementation preferences of analysts for health economic evaluations. Although in principle the choice of software should have no impact on the quality of the statistical methods implemented, it has been highlighted how use of simpler software (e.g. spreadsheet calculators such as Excel) may become increasingly cumbersome for matching more realistic and therefore complex modelling requirements.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1: Heatmap of the combination of software programs used\n\n\n\nThe most popular software was SPSS, chosen by 87 (52%) of the studies, either in the base-case (33%) or secondary (19%) analyses, often used in combination with Excel or by itself. When either STATA (26%) or R (13%) was used in the base-case analysis, SPSS was still the most popular choice in secondary analyses. Other combinations of software were less frequently chosen, even though 38 (23%) of the studies were unclear about the software implemented.\n\n\nMissing data methods\nAcross both periods limited changes are observed in terms of order of choice for missing data methods, with MI being the most popular base-case analysis, followed by complete case analysis (CCA), as the most popular SA choice. However, two noticeable variations in the frequency of these methods are observed between the two periods. First, the proportion of studies using MI in the base-case analysis has considerably increased over time (from 28 to 39%), which is compensated by a decrease in the proportion of less advanced methods such as CCA (from 14 to 5%) and single imputation (SI) (from 21 to 16%). Second, the number of studies not clearly reporting the methods has also considerably decreased (from 12 to 5%). The observed trend between the two periods may be the result of the specific recommendations from the 2016 guidelines in regards to the ‘optimal’ missing data strategy, resulting in a more frequent adoption of MI techniques and, at the same time, a less frequent use of CCA in the base-case analysis. However, in contrast to these guidelines, a large number of studies still does not perform any SA to missing data assumptions (about 65% in 2010–2015 and 63% in 2016–2020).\nMost of the studies lie in the middle and lower parts of the plot, and are associated with a limited or sufficient quality of information. However, only a few of these studies rely on very strong and unjustified missing data assumptions, while the majority provides either adequate justifications or uses methods associated with weak assumptions. Only 11 (14%) studies are associated with both high-quality scores and less restrictive missingness assumptions. No study was associated with either full information or adequate justifications for the assumptions explored in base-case and sensitivity analysis.\n\n\nDiscussion\nDescriptive information extracted from the reviewed studies provides some first insights about changes in practice in the years following the publication of the guidelines. First, a clear trend is observed towards an increase in the adoption of a societal and health care perspective and of CUA as the reference base-case analysis approach. Second, a similar increment is observed in the use of recommended instruments for the collection and valuation of health economic outcomes, such as EQ-5D-5L for QALYs and friction method for costs. Most of these changes are in accordance with the 2016 guidelines, which are likely to have played a role in influencing analysts and practitioners towards a clearer and more standardised way to report health economic results.\nWhen looking at the type of statistical methods used to perform the analysis, an important shift occurs between the two periods towards the use of methods that allow for regression adjustment, with a considerable uptake in the use of SURs and LMMs in the context of empirical analyses. These techniques are strongly supported by the 2016 guidelines in that they allow us to correct for potential bias due to confounding effects, deal with clustered data and formally take into account the correlation between costs and effects. Bootstrapping remains the most popular methods to quantify uncertainty around parameter estimates across both periods. However, the health economic analysis framework requires that the level of complexity of the analysis model is reflected in the way uncertainty surrounding the estimates is generated.\nThe transition between the two time periods reveals an increase in the use of MI techniques in the base-case analysis together with a decrease in the overall use of CCA. This change is in line with the 2016 guidelines which warns about the inherent limitations and potential bias of simple methods (e.g. CCA) when compared to MI as the potential reference method to handle missing values. Nevertheless, improvements are still needed given that many studies (more than 6%) performed the analysis under a single missing data assumption. This is not ideal since by definition missing data assumptions can never be checked, making the results obtained under a specific method (i.e. assumption) potentially biased.\n\n\nConclusions\nGiven the complexity of the health economics framework, the implementation of simple but likely inadequate analytic approaches may lead to imprecise cost-effectiveness results. This is a potentially serious issue for bodies such as ZIN in the Netherlands that use these evaluations in their decision making, thus possibly leading to incorrect policy decisions about the cost-effectiveness of new health care interventions. Our review shows, over time, a change in common practice with respect to different analysis components in accordance with the recent ZIN’s 2016 guidelines. This is an encouraging movement towards the standardised use of more suitable and robust analytic methods in terms of both statistical, uncertainty and missing data analysis. Improvements are however still needed, particularly in the choice of adequate statistical techniques to deal with the complexity of the data analysed and in the assessment of the impact of alternative missing data assumptions on the results in SA."

    "section": "",
    "text": "Economic evaluation alongside Randomised Clinical Trials (RCTs) is an important and increasingly popular component of the process of technology appraisal. The typical analysis of individual level data involves the comparison of two interventions for which suitable measures of clinical benefits and costs are observed on each patient enrolled in the trial at different time points throughout the follow up. Individual level data from RCTs are almost invariably affected by missingness. The recorded outcome process is often incomplete due to individuals who drop out or are observed intermittently throughout the study, causing some observations to be missing. In most applications, the economic evaluation is performed on the cross-sectional variables, computed using only the data from the individuals who are observed at each time point in the trial (completers), with at most limited sensitivity analysis to missingness assumptions. This, however, is an extremely inefficient approach as the information from the responses of all partially observed subjects is completely lost and it is also likely biased unless the completers are a random sample of the subjects on each arm. The problem of missingness is often embedded within a more complex framework, which makes the modelling task in economic evaluations particularly challenging. Specifically, the effectiveness and cost data typically present a series of complexities that need to be simultaneously addressed to avoid biased results.\nUsing a recent randomised trial as our motivating example, we present a Bayesian parametric model for conducting inference on a bivariate health economic longitudinal response. We specify our model to account for the different types of complexities affecting the data while accommodating a sensitivity analysis to explore the impact of alternative missingness assumptions on the inferences and on the decision-making process for health technology assessment."

    "text": "Modelling framework\nThe distribution of the observed responses \\(\\boldsymbol y_{ijt}=(u_{ijv},c_{ijt})\\) is specified in terms of a model for the utility and cost variables at time \\(j=\\{0,1,2\\}\\), which are jointly modelled without using a multilevel approach and separately by treatment group. In particular, the joint distribution for \\(\\boldsymbol y_{ijt}\\) is specified as a series of conditional distributions that capture the dependence between utilities and costs as well as the time dependence.\nFollowing the recommendations from the published literature, we account for the skewness using Beta and Log-Normal distributions for the utilities and costs, respectively. Since the Beta distribution does not allow for negative values, we scaled the utilities on \\([0,1]\\) through the transformation \\(u^{\\star}_{ij}=\\frac{u_{ij}-\\text{min}(\\boldsymbol u_{j})}{\\text{max}(\\boldsymbol u_{j})-\\text{min}(\\boldsymbol u_{j})}\\), and fit the model to these transformed variables. To account for the structural values \\(u_{ij} = 1\\) and \\(c_{ij} = 0\\) we use a hurdle approach by including in the model the indicator variables \\(d^u_{ij}:=\\mathbb{I}(u_{ij}=1)\\) and \\(d^c_{ij}:=\\mathbb{I}(c_{ij}=0)\\), which take value \\(1\\) if subject \\(i\\) is associated with a structural value at time \\(j\\) and 0 otherwise. The probabilities of observing these values, as well as the mean of each variable, are then modelled conditionally on other variables via linear regressions defined on the logit or log scale. Specifically, at time \\(j=1,2\\), the probability of observing a zero and the mean costs are modelled conditionally on the utilities and costs at the previous times, while the probability of observing a one and the mean utilities are modelled conditionally on the current costs (also at \\(j=0\\)) and the utilities at the previous times (only at \\(j=\\{1,2\\}\\)). The model is summarised by Figure 1:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1: Longitudinal model for missingness.\n\n\n\nWe use partial identifying restrictions to link the observed data distribution \\(p(\\boldsymbol y_{obs},\\boldsymbol r)\\) to the extrapolation distribution \\(p(\\boldsymbol y_{mis} \\mid \\boldsymbol y_{obs},\\boldsymbol r)\\) and consider interpretable deviations from a benchmark scenario to assess how inferences are driven by our assumptions. Specifically, we identify the marginal mean of the missing responses in each pattern \\(\\boldsymbol y^{\\boldsymbol r}_{mis}\\) by averaging across the corresponding components that are observed and add the sensitivity parameters \\(\\boldsymbol \\Delta_j\\).\nWe define \\(\\boldsymbol \\Delta_j=(\\Delta_{c_{j}},\\Delta_{u_{j}})\\) to be time-specific location shifts at the marginal mean in each pattern and set \\(\\boldsymbol \\Delta_j = \\boldsymbol 0\\) as the benchmark scenario. We then explore departures from this benchmark using alternative priors on \\(\\boldsymbol \\Delta_j\\), which are calibrated using the observed standard deviations for costs and utilities at each time \\(j\\) to define the amplitude of the departures from \\(\\boldsymbol \\Delta_j=\\boldsymbol 0\\)."

    "section": "",
    "text": "Introduction\nCost‐effectiveness analyses (CEAs) conducted alongside randomised controlled trials are an important source of information for decision-makers in the process of technology appraisal (Ramsey et al., 2015). The analysis is based on healthcare outcome data and health service use, typically collected at multiple time points and then combined into overall measures of effectiveness and cost. A popular approach to handle missingness is to discard the participants with incomplete observations (complete case analysis or CCA), allowing for derivation of the overall measures based on the completers alone. We note that slightly different definitions of CCA are possible, depending on the form of the model of interest, the type of missingness and the inclusion of observed covariates. This approach, although appealing by its simplicity, has well-recognised limitations including loss of efficiency and an increased risk of bias. We propose the use of linear mixed effects models (LMMs) as an alternative approach under MAR. LMMs are commonly used for the modelling of dependent data (e.g. repeated-measures) and belong to the general class of likelihood-based methods. LMMs appear surprisingly uncommon for the analysis of repeated measures in trial-based CEA, perhaps because of a lack of awareness or familiarity with fitting LMMs.\n\n\nMethods\nLinear mixed model extends the usual linear model framework by the addition of “random effect” terms, which can take into account the dependence between observations.\n\\[\nY_{ij}=\\beta_1+\\beta_2 X_{i1}+\\ldots+\\beta_(P+1) X_{iP}+\\omega_i+\\epsilon_{ij},\n\\tag{1}\\]\nwhere \\(Y_{ij}\\) denotes the outcome repeatedly collected for each individual \\(i=1,\\ldots,N\\) at multiple times \\(j=1,\\ldots,J\\). The model parameters commonly referred to as fixed effects include an intercept \\(\\beta_1\\) and the coefficients \\((\\beta_2,\\ldots,\\beta_{(P+1)})\\) associated with the predictors \\(X_{i1},\\ldots,X_{iP}\\), while \\(\\omega_i\\) and \\(\\epsilon_{ij}\\) are two random terms: \\(\\epsilon_{ij}\\) is the usual error term and \\(\\omega_i\\) is a random intercept which captures variation in outcomes between individuals. The models can be extended to deal with more complex structures, for example by allowing the effect of the covariates to vary across individuals (random slope) or a different covariance structure of the errors. LMMs can be fitted even if some outcome data are missing and provide correct inferences under MAR.\nA particular type of LMMs commonly used in the analysis of repeated measures in clinical trials is referred to as Mixed Model for Repeated Measurement (MMRM). The model includes a categorical effect for time, an interaction between time and treatment arm, and allows errors to have different variance and correlation over time (i.e. unstructured covariance structure). Figure 1 shows some examples of possible covariance structures that may be explored for LMMs.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1: Some examples of covariance structures in LMM\n\n\n\nIncremental (between-group) or marginal (within-group) estimates for aggregated outcomes over the trial period, such as quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) or total costs can be retrieved as linear combinations of the parameter estimates from Equation 1. For example, the mean difference in total cost is obtained by summing up the estimated differences at each follow-up point, while differences on a QALY scale can be obtained as weighted linear combinations of the coefficient estimates of the utility model.\n\n\nConclusions\nWe believe LMMs represent an alternative approach which can overcome some of these limitations.\n\nFirst, practitioners may be more comfortable with the standard regression framework.\nSecond, LMMs can be tailored to address other data features (e.g. cluster-randomised trials or non-normal distribution) while also easily combined with bootstrapping.\nThird, LMMs do not rely on imputation, and results are therefore deterministic and easily reproducible, whereas the Monte Carlo error associated with multiple imputation may cause results to vary from one imputation to another, unless the number of imputations is sufficiently large.\n\nAlthough the methodology illustrated is already known, particularly in the area of statistical analyses, to our knowledge LMMs have rarely been applied to health economic data collected alongside randomised trials. We believe the proposed methods is preferable to a complete-case analysis when CEA data are incomplete, and that it can offer an interesting alternative to imputation methods."

    "text": "Modelling Framework\nWe propose a unified Bayesian framework that jointly accounts for the typical complexities of the data (e.g. correlation, skewness, spikes at the boundaries and missingness), and that can be implemented in a relatively easy way.\nConsider the usual cross-sectional bivariate outcome formed by the QALYs and total cost variables \\((e_{it}, c_{it})\\) calculated for the \\(i-\\)th person in group \\(t\\) of the trial. To simplify the notation, unless necessary, we suppress the treatment indicator \\(t\\). Equation 1 specifies the joint distribution \\(p(e_i,c_i)\\) as\n\\[\np(e_i,c_i) = p(c_i)p(e_i\\mid c_i) = p(e_i)p(c_i\\mid e_i)\n\\tag{1}\\]\nwhere, for example, \\(p(e_i)\\) is the marginal distribution of the QALYs and \\(p(c_i\\mid e_i)\\) is the conditional distribution of the costs given the QALYs. Note that, although the two factorisations are mathematically equivalent, the choice of which to use has different practical implications. From a statistical point of view, the factorisations require the specifications of different statistical models, e.g. \\(p(e_i)\\) or \\(p(e_i\\mid c_i)\\), which may have different approximation errors. From a clinical point of view, the two versions make different assumptions about the casual relationships between the outcomes, i.e. either \\(e_i\\) determines \\(c_i\\) or vice versa. We describe our analysis under the assumption that the costs are determined by the effectiveness measures and therefore we specify the joint distribution \\(p(e_i,c_i)\\) in terms of a marginal distribution for the QALYs and a conditional distribution for the costs.\nFor each individual we consider a marginal distribution \\(p(e_i \\mid \\boldsymbol \\theta_e)\\) indexed by a set of parameters \\(\\boldsymbol \\theta_e\\) comprising a location \\(\\boldsymbol \\phi_{ie}\\) and a set of ancillary parameters \\(\\boldsymbol\\psi_e\\) typically including some measure of marginal variance \\(\\sigma^2_e\\). Equation 2 models the location parameter using a generalised linear structure\n\\[\ng_e(\\phi_{ie})= \\alpha_0 \\,\\,[+ \\ldots]\n\\tag{2}\\]\nwhere \\(\\alpha\\_0\\) is the intercept and the notation \\([+\\ldots]\\) indicates that other terms (e.g. quantifying the effect of relevant covariates) may or may not be included. In the absence of covariates or assuming that a centered version \\(x_i^{\\star} = (x_i - \\bar{x})\\) is used, the parameter \\(\\mu_e = g_e^{-1}(\\alpha_0)\\) represents the population average QALYs. For the costs, we consider a conditional model \\(p(c_i\\mid e_i,\\boldsymbol\\theta_c)\\), which explicitly depends on the QALYs, as well as on a set of quantities \\(\\boldsymbol\\theta_c\\), again comprising a location \\(\\phi_{ic}\\) and ancillary parameters \\(\\boldsymbol \\psi_{c}\\). For example, when normal distributions are assumed for both \\(p(e_i \\mid \\boldsymbol \\theta\\_e)\\) and \\(p(c_i \\mid e_i, \\boldsymbol \\theta_c)\\), i.e. bivariate normal on both outcomes, the ancillary parameters \\(\\boldsymbol\\psi_c\\) include a conditional variance \\(\\tau^2_c\\), which can be expressed as a function of the marginal variance \\(\\sigma^2_c\\). More specifically, the conditional variance of \\(p(c_i \\mid e_i, \\boldsymbol \\theta_c)\\) is a function of the marginal effectiveness and cost variances and has the closed form \\(\\tau^2_c=\\sigma^2_c - \\sigma^2_e \\beta^2\\), where \\(\\beta=\\rho \\frac{\\sigma_c}{\\sigma_e}\\) and \\(\\rho\\) is the parameter capturing the correlation between the variables.\nEquation 3 models the location as a function of the QALYs as\n\\[\ng\\_c(\\phi\\_{ic}) = \\beta\\_{0} + \\beta\\_{1}(e\\_{i}-\\mu\\_{e})\\,\\,[+\\ldots]\n\\tag{3}\\]\nHere, \\((e_i-\\mu_e)\\) is the centered version of the QALYs, while \\(\\beta_{1}\\) quantifies the correlation between costs and QALYs. Assuming other covariates are either also centered or absent, \\(\\mu_c = g_c^{-1}(\\beta_{0})\\) is the estimated population average cost. The Figure 1 shows a graphical representation of the general modelling framework.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1: Modelling framework.\n\n\n\nThe QALYs and cost distributions are represented in terms of combined modules, the blue and the red boxes, in which the random quantities are linked through logical relationships. This ensures the full characterisation of the uncertainty for each variable in the model. Notably, this is general enough to be extended to any suitable distributional assumption, as well as to handle covariates in either or both the modules.\nThe proposed framework allows jointly tackling of the different complexities that affect the data in a relatively easy way by means of its modular structure and flexible choice for the distributions of the QALYs and cost variables. Using the MenSS trial as motivating example, we start from the original analysis and expand the model using alternative specifications that progressively account for an increasing number of complexities in the outcomes. We specifically focus on appropriately modelling spikes at the boundary and missingness, as they have substantial implications in terms of inferences and, crucially, cost-effectiveness results.\n\n\nExample\nThree model specifications are considered and applied to QALY data from a RCT case study: 1) Normal marginal for the QALYs and Normal conditional for the costs (which is identical to a Bivariate Normal distribution for the two outcomes); 2) Beta marginal for the QALYs and Gamma conditional for the costs; and 3) Hurdle Model. Figure 2 shows the observed QALYs in both treatment groups (indicated with black crosses) as well as summaries of the posterior distributions for the imputed values, obtained from each model. Imputations are distinguished based on whether the corresponding baseline utility value is observed or missing (blue or red lines and dots, respectively) and are summarised in terms of posterior mean and \\(90\\%\\) HPD intervals.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2: Imputed QALYs under alternative model specifications.\n\n\n\nThere are clear differences in the imputed values and corresponding credible intervals between the three models in both treatment groups. Neither the Bivariate Normal nor the Beta-Gamma models produce imputed values that capture the structural one component in the data. In addition, as to be expected, the Bivariate Normal fails to respect the natural support for the observed QALYs, with many of the imputations exceeding the unit threshold bound. These unrealistic imputed values highlight the inadequacy of the Normal distribution for the data and may lead to distorted inferences. Conversely, imputations under the Hurdle Model are more realistic, as they can replicate values in the whole range of the observed data, including the structural ones. Imputed unit QALYs with no discernible interval are only observed in the intervention group due to the original data composition, i.e. individuals associated with a unit baseline utility and missing QALYs are almost exclusively present in the intervention group.\n\n\nConclusions\nWe have presented a flexible Bayesian framework that can handle the typical complexities affecting outcome data in CEA, while also being relatively easy to implement using freely available Bayesian software. This is a key advantage that can encourage practitioners to move away from likely biased methods and promote the use of our framework in routine analyses. In conclusion, the proposed framework can:\n\nJointly model costs and QALYs;\nAccount for skewness and structural values;\nAssess the robustness of the results under a set of differing missingness assumptions.\n\nThe original contribution of this work consists in the joint implementation of methods that account for the complexities of the data within a unique and flexible framework that is relatively easy to apply. In the next chapter we will take a step forward in the analysis and present a longitudinal model that can use all observed utility and cost data in the analysis, explore alternative nonignorable missing data assumptions, while simultaneously handling the complexities that affect the data."

In these studies, cost and effectiveness outcomes are commonly measured at multiple time points, but some observations may be missing. Restricting the analysis to the participants with complete data can lead to biased and inefficient estimates. Methods, such as multiple imputation, have been recommended as they make better use of the data available and are valid under less restrictive Missing At Random (MAR) assumption. Linear mixed effects models (LMMs) offer a simple alternative to handle missing data under MAR without requiring imputations, and have not been very well explored in the CEA context. In this manuscript, we aim to familiarise readers with LMMs and demonstrate their implementation in CEA. We illustrate the approach on a randomised trial of antidepressant, and provide the implementation code in R and Stata.

    "section": "",
    "text": "Abstract\nPatient-level health economic data collected alongside clinical trials are an important component of the process of technology appraisal, with a view to informing resource allocation decisions. For end of life treatments, such as cancer treatments, modelling of cost-effectiveness/utility data may involve some form of partitioned survival analysis, where measures of health-related quality of life and survival time for both pre- and post-progression periods are combined to generate some aggregate measure of clinical benefits (e.g. quality-adjusted survival). In addition, resource use data are often collected from health records on different services from which different cost components are obtained (e.g. treatment, hospital or adverse events costs). A critical problem in these analyses is that both effectiveness and cost data present some complexities, including non-normality, spikes, and missingness, that should be addressed using appropriate methods. Bayesian modelling provides a powerful tool which has become more and more popular in the recent health economics and statistical literature to jointly handle these issues in a relatively easy way. This paper presents a general Bayesian framework that takes into account the complex relationships of trial-based partitioned survival cost-utility data, potentially providing a more adequate evidence for policymakers to inform the decision-making process.

    "section": "",
    "text": "Abstract\nThe evidence produced by healthcare economic evaluation studies is a key component of any health technology assessment (HTA) process designed to inform resource allocation decisions in a budget limited context. To improve the quality (and harmonize the generation process) of such evidence, many HTA agencies have established methodological guidelines describing the normative framework inspiring their decision-making process. The information requirements that economic evaluation analyses for HTA must satisfy typically involve the use of complex quantitative syntheses of multiple available datasets, handling mixtures of aggregate and patient-level information, and the use of sophisticated statistical models for the analysis of non-Normal data (e.g. time-to-event, quality of life and costs). Much of the recent methodological research in economic evaluation for healthcare has developed in response to these needs, in terms of sound statistical decision-theoretic foundations, and is increasingly being formulated within a Bayesian paradigm. The rationale for this preference lies in the fact that by taking a probabilistic approach, based on decision rules and available information, a Bayesian economic evaluation study can explicitly account for relevant sources of uncertainty in the decision process and produce information to identify an optimal course of actions. Moreover, the Bayesian approach naturally allows the incorporation of an element of judgement or evidence from different sources (e.g.~expert opinion or multiple studies) into the analysis. This is particularly important when, as often occurs in economic evaluation for HTA, the evidence base is sparse and requires some inevitable mathematical modelling to bridge the gaps in the available data. The availability of free and open source software in the last two decades has greatly reduced the computational costs and facilitated the application of Bayesian methods and has the potential to improve the work of modellers and regulators alike, thus advancing the fields of economic evaluation of health care interventions. This chapter provides an overview of the areas where Bayesian methods have contributed to the address the methodological needs that stem from the normative framework adopted by a number of HTA agencies.\n\n\n\n\n\nCitationBibTeX citation:@online{gabrio2019,\n  author = {Gabrio, Andrea and Baio, Gianluca and Manca, Andrea},\n  title = {Bayesian {Statistical} {Economic} {Evaluation} {Methods} for\n    {Health} {Technology} {Assessment}},\n  date = {2019-06-01},\n  url = {https://oxfordre.com/economics/view/10.1093/acrefore/9780190625979.001.0001/acrefore-9780190625979-e-451},\n  doi = {10.1093/acrefore/9780190625979.013.451},\n  langid = {en},\n  abstract = {{[}The evidence produced by healthcare economic evaluation\n    studies is a key component of any health technology assessment (HTA)\n    process ...{]}\\{style=“font-size: 85\\%”\\}}\n}\nFor attribution, please cite this work as:\nGabrio, Andrea, Gianluca Baio, and Andrea Manca. 2019. “Bayesian\nStatistical Economic Evaluation Methods for Health Technology\nAssessment.” Oxford Research Encyclopedia of Economics and\nFinance, Oxford University Press.

    "section": "",
    "text": "Abstract\nCost-effectiveness analyses (CEAs) alongside randomised controlled trials (RCTs) are increasingly designed to collect resource use and preference-based health status data for the purpose of healthcare technology assessment. However, because of the way these measures are collected, they are prone to missing data, which can ultimately affect the decision of whether an intervention is good value for money. We examine how missing cost and effect outcome data are handled in RCT-based CEAs, complementing a previous review (covering 2003-2009, 88 articles) with a new systematic review (2009-2015, 81 articles) focussing on two different perspectives. First, we provide guidelines on how the information about missingness and related methods should be presented to improve the reporting and handling of missing data. We propose to address this issue by means of a quality evaluation scheme, providing a structured approach that can be used to guide the collection of information, elicitation of the assumptions, choice of methods and considerations of possible limitations of the given missingness problem. Second, we review the description of the missing data, the statistical methods used to deal with them and the quality of the judgement underpinning the choice of these methods. Our review shows that missing data in within-RCT CEAs are still often inadequately handled and the overall level of information provided to support the chosen methods is rarely satisfactory\n      \n\n\n\n\nCitationBibTeX citation:@online{gabrio2017,\n  author = {Gabrio, Andrea and J Mason, Alexina and Baio, Gianluca},\n  title = {Handling {Missing} {Data} in {Within-Trial}\n    {Cost-Effectiveness} {Analysis:} {A} {Review} with {Future}\n    {Recommendations}},\n  volume = {1},\n  number = {2},\n  date = {2017-06-01},\n  url = {https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s41669-017-0015-6},\n  doi = {10.1007/s41669-017-0015-6},\n  langid = {en},\n  abstract = {{[}Cost-effectiveness analyses (CEAs) alongside randomised\n    controlled trials (RCTs) are increasingly designed\n    ...{]}\\{style=“font-size: 85\\%”\\}}\n}\nFor attribution, please cite this work as:\nGabrio, Andrea, Alexina J Mason, and Gianluca Baio. 2017.\n“Handling Missing Data in Within-Trial Cost-Effectiveness\nAnalysis: A Review with Future Recommendations.”\nPharmacoeconomics-Open.

    "section": "",
    "text": "I did not have much time to post anything this month until now as it has been a quite busy period. I have been involved in many different works and I have also involved other people in what I think could be some very interesting new projects. Not that I complain about having many different things to do (most of them are actually cool) but doing everything in a short period is not the best.\nA couple of things have come/are coming up. First, I have seriously started working on the coding of a decision model for some health economic evaluation project I have been involved in since last year. Everything seems ok after I spent lots of days and time fixing some small bugs in my code. I am about half way through the model and I hope I will be able to finish it before Christmas (I doubt it though).\nSecond, I have finished reviewing an interesting paper about some new methods for improving current practice for dealing with missing data, which I kinda enjoy reading (very good!).\nThird, I would like to quickly summarise my first experience at ISPOR Europe in Copenhagen. I was really excited to attend this conference which, as expected, revealed itself as huge with people coming from all over the world and with many interesting sessions and discussion topics. I had the chance to meet new and old people, such as professor Andrea Manca and the always very kind Chris Sampson for whom I was like a stalker asking for more and more information about himself and his work. I also met some of my old collegues from MapiGroup, now under ICON plc. It was very fun to hang out with these old friends and see what they have been up to during this time. Among them, I gladly caught up with my dear friend Ryan Pulleyblank, now doing a PhD at the University of Southern Denmark. My poster was a success with (unexpectedly) many people stopping by and asking for more information on my work. I was genuinely surprised by this as ISPOR is mostly a conference dedicated to companies rather than academic works and networking. To sum up, it was a very nice and fun experience and despite the level of statistical methodology was not particularly high I enjoyed my time there and I also had the chance to visit Copenhagen for the first time.\nFinally, as a side note, I have found the time to upload on my arXiv page a nice application of Bayesian hierarchical models for the prediction of volleyball matches which I have been working on the past summer, taking inspiration from the work of Gianluca about predicting football macthes. I hope my work can turn out in something cool as well.\n\n\n\n\n\nThis is all for the moment but soon I will be heading back to another quite busy period for me. I hope this will be the last for some time, especially given that Christmas is coming and I would like to have some free time to properly enjoy this period, which I really like, even more than Christmas itself."

First, the paper I wrote with Michael and Gianluca on Bayesian methods for longitudinal data in trial-based economic evaluations has finally been published as early view on JRSSA. As I said in some earlier posts, I am super happy about this collaboration and I hope I can continue working on similar projects in the future.\nSecond, I will soon give a talk about this work at the ICTMC conference in Brighton, next Monday. This will be the first time at this conference and unfortunately I will only be able to remain around for one day as I need to go back to London pretty soon. I hope I will be able to enjoy my day at the conference, even though I will miss the talks of Baptiste and Alexina which are scheduled for the last day of the conference. I hope I can at least have a quick chat with them the day I am around.\n\n\n\n\n\nI am also excited to visit Brighton, since many people keep telling me that I should go and visit this sort of british version of “Rimini”. To be honest, I do not expect to find a nice weather, given that in this period it is raining a lot in London, but I hope I will be lucky and get the only sunny day of the week.\nFinally, I have started a rubric called missing data on my website, where I try to describe some of the most popular methods to handle missing data and to provide some references for anyone who could be interested in this field. I am really fascinated by statistical methods for dealing with missingness, perhaps because it was the main focus of my PhD, but I am eager to review different methods and see if I can find something really interesting. Of course, to complete this it will take more time, which I hope I will be able to find in the next months."

I already new this blog but I have never had a proper chance to read through its posts carefully, which is a shame.\n\n\n\n\n\nI shall promise myself to try to check it more often from now on, using this interview as a nice motivation to do so. In fact, there are not many blogs around health economics matters (here a non-comprehensive list), among which The Academic Health Economists and Gianluca’s blog are my favourites.\nI hope I will be able to find some time to write some nice posts about some health economic applications of my work in the next future as this is still the most interesting field for me at the moment."

    "section": "",
    "text": "I have just come back form my first Health Economists’ Study Group (HESG) meeting, which this year was held at the University of East Anglia in the beautiful city of Norwich, south east of England, and where I presented some preliminary results from one of my on-going works. I have to say, it was a remarkable experience which I really liked thanks to a wonderful and welcoming environment. I had the pleasure to talk to many people from different research areas involved in health economics (both from academia and industry) and to see many different projects and works.\nI particularly enjoy the structure of the meeting, which requires some chair and discussant who have to present and discuss the paper of the authors, who are only allowed to provide some clarification if needed. At first I thought this structure of the sessions was strange, but after attending many sessions and experiencing this for my own paper, I feel that it is a very good way to encourage discussion about works from different people rather than just focussing on your own presentation. Plus, the weather and always sunny, it felt like Italy for a few days.\n\n\n\nThe beautiful Norwich’s cathedral\n\n\nOther nice people and colleagues from HEART and other UCL department came to HESG with me, including Caroline and Ekaterina (aka Katia), you can see them in thumbnail of this post. I was also pleased to meet Baptiste from LSHTM, who shares with me the interest in missing data methods for cost-effectiveness analysis and who presented some very nice work on that. I had the chance to give some feedback to him and he did the same for me. It felt so nice when we started discussing about some aspects of our analyses and after some minutes we simply lost track of time and everyone else disappeared. I also had the opportunity to talk about my work with the discussant of my session, Catrin Plumpton from the Centre for Health Economics and Medicines Evaluation, who gave me some nice feedback which I really appreciated, especially given her mathematical background.\nAn important contribution to the success of the meeting was also given by the wonderful organisation of the event, including an accommodation located very closely to the main building of the meeting, plenty of food provided during each day, a nice bus tour of the city and a wonderful conference dinner. I must thank all the people, who organised the event who were very extremely nice to us and who were always ready to help us for whatever need we had, with a special mention for Emma Mcmanus who was amazing.\n\n\n\n\n\nIn summary, everything was good. Well, almost. Going back to the works presented, as usual, the only less positive note that I would like to make is the almost total absence of Bayesian applications. Some authors mentioned that they used some popular Bayesian program, such as WinBUGS, but this was mainly related to the usual meta-analysis stuff which is pretty standardised. I hope next time I will be able to see more people going Bayesian as this is what I am."

    "title": "Weighting Adjustments",
    "section": "",
    "text": "The notion of reducing bias due to missingness through reweighting methods has its root in the survey literature and the basic idea is closely related to weighting in randomisation inference for finite population surveys (Little and Rubin (2019)). In particular, in probability sampling, a unit selected from a target population with probability \\(\\pi_i\\) can be thought as “representing” \\(\\pi^{-1}_i\\) units in the population and hence should be given weight \\(\\pi^{-1}_i\\) when estimating population quantities. For example, in a stratified random sample, a selected unit in stratum \\(j\\) represents \\(\\frac{N_j}{n_j}\\) population units, where \\(n_j\\) indicates the units sampled from the \\(N_j\\) population units in stratum \\(j=1,\\ldots,J\\). The population total \\(T\\) can then be estimated by the weighted sum\n\\[\nT = \\sum_{i=1}^{n}y_i\\pi^{-1}_i,\n\\]\nknown as the Horvitz-Thompson estimate (Horvitz and Thompson (1952)), while the stratified mean can be written as\n\\[\n\\bar{y}_{w} = \\frac{1}{n}\\sum_{i=1}^{n}w_iy_i,\n\\]\nwhere \\(w_i=\\frac{n\\pi^{-1}_i}{\\sum_{k=1}^n\\pi^{-1}_k}\\) is the sampling weight attached to the \\(i\\)-th unit scaled tosum up to the sample size \\(n\\). Weighting class estimators extend this approach to handle missing data such that, if the probabilities of response for unit \\(\\phi_i\\) were known, then the probability of selection and response is \\(\\pi_i\\phi_i\\) and we have\n\\[\n\\bar{y}_{w} = \\frac{1}{n_r}\\sum_{i=1}^{n_r}w_iy_i,\n\\]\nwhere the sum is now over responding units and \\(w_i=\\frac{n_r(\\pi_i\\phi_i)^{-1}}{\\sum_{k=1}^{n_r}(\\pi_k\\phi_k)^{-1}}\\). In practice, the response probability \\(\\phi_i\\) is not known and is typically estimated based on the information available for respondents and nonrespondents (Schafer and Graham (2002))."

    "text": "Weighting Class Estimator of the Mean\nA simple reweighting approach is to partition the sample into \\(J\\) “weighting classes” according to the variables observed for respondents and nonrespondents. If \\(n_j\\) is the sample size, \\(n_{rj}\\) the number of respondents in class \\(j\\), with \\(n_r=\\sum_{j=1}^Jr_j\\), then a simple estimator of the response probability for units in class \\(j\\) is given by \\(\\frac{n_{rj}}{n_j}\\). Thus, responding units in class \\(j\\) receive weight \\(w_i=\\frac{n_r(\\pi_i\\hat{\\phi}_i)^{-1}}{\\sum_{k=1}^{n_r}(\\pi_k\\hat{\\phi}_k)^{-1}}\\), where \\(\\hat{\\phi}_i=\\frac{n_{rj}}{n_j}\\) for unit \\(i\\) in class \\(j\\). The weighting class estimate of the mean is then\n\\[\n\\bar{y}_{w} = \\frac{1}{n_r}\\sum_{i=1}^{n_r}w_iy_i,\n\\]\nwhich is unbiased under the quasirandomisation assumption (Oh and Scheuren (1983)), which requires respondents in weighting class \\(j\\) to be a random sample of the sampled units, i.e. data are Missing Completely At Random (MCAR) within adjustment class \\(j\\). Weighting class adjustments are simple because the same weights are obtained regardless of the outcome tp which they are applied, but these are inefficient and generally involves an increase in sampling variance for outcomes that are weakly related to the weighting class variable. Assuming random sampling within weighting classes, a constant variance \\(\\sigma^2\\) for an outcome \\(y\\), and ignoring sampling variation in the weights, the increase in sampling variance of a sample mean is\n\\[\n\\text{Var}\\left(\\frac{1}{n_{r}}\\sum_{i=1}^{n_{r}}w_iy_i \\right) = \\frac{\\sigma^2}{n_{r}^2}\\left(\\sum_{i=1}^{n_{r}}w_{i}^{2} \\right) = \\frac{\\sigma^2}{n_{r}}(1+\\text{cv}^2(w_i)),\n\\]\nwhere \\(\\text{cv}(w_i)\\) is the coefficient of variation of the weights (scaled to average one), which is a rough measure of the proportional increase in sampling variance due to weighting (Kish (1992)). When the weighting class variable is predictive of \\(y\\), weighting methods can lead to a reduction in sampling variance. Little and Rubin (2019) summarise the effect of weighting on the bias and sampling variance of an estimated mean, according to whether the associations between the adjustment cells and the outcome \\(y\\) and missing indicator \\(m\\) are high or low.\n\nEffect of weighting adjustments on bias and sampling variance of a mean.\n\n\n\nLow (y)\nHigh (y)\n\n\n\n\nLow (m)\nbias: /, var: /\nbias: /, var: -\n\n\nHigh (m)\nbias: /, var: +\nbias: -, var: -\n\n\n\n\n\nThus, weighting is only effective when the outcome is associated with the adjustment cell variable because otherwise the sampling variance is increased with no bias reduction."

    "text": "Propensity Weighting\nIn some settings, weighting class estimates cannot be feasibly derived by all recorded variables X because the number of classes become too large and some may include cells with nonrespondents but no respondents for which the nonresponse weight is infinite. The theory of propensity scores (Rosenbaum and Rubin (1983)) provides a prescription for choosing the coarsest reduction of the variables to a weighting class variable \\(c\\). Suppose the data are Missing At Random (MAR) such that\n\\[\np(m\\mid X,y,\\phi)=p(m\\mid X,\\phi),\n\\]\nwhere \\(\\phi\\) are unknown parameters and define the nonresponse propensity for unit \\(i\\) as\n\\[\n\\rho(x_i,\\phi)=p(m_i=1 \\mid \\phi),\n\\]\nassuming that this is strictly positive for all values of \\(x_i\\). Then, it can be shown that\n\\[\np(m\\mid \\rho(X,\\phi),y,\\phi)=p(m\\mid \\rho(X,\\phi),\\phi),\n\\]\nso that respondents are a random subsample within strata defined by the propensity score \\(\\rho(X,\\phi)\\). In practice the parameter \\(\\phi\\) is unknown and must be estimated from sample data, for example via logistic, probit or robit regressions of the missingness indicator \\(m\\) on \\(X\\) based on respondent and nonrespondent data (Liu (2004)). A variant of this procedure is to weight respondents \\(i\\) directly by the inverse of the estimated propensity score \\(\\rho(X,\\hat{\\phi})^{-1}\\) (Cassel, Sarndal, and Wretman (1983)), which allows to remove bias but may cause two problems: 1) estimates may be associated with very high sampling variances due to nonrespondents with low response propensity estimates receiving large nonresponse weights; 2) more reliance on correct model specification of the propensity score regression than response propensity stratification."

    "text": "It is possible to summarise the steps involved in drawing inference from incomplete data as (Daniels and Hogan (2008)):\nIdentification of a full data model, particularly the part involving the missing data \\(Y_{mis}\\), requires making unverifiable assumptions about the full data model \\(f(y,r)\\). Under the assumption of the ignorability of the missingness mechanism, the model can be identified using only the information from the observed data. When ignorability is not believed to be a suitable assumption, one can use a more general class of models that allows missing data indicators to depend on missing responses themselves. These models allow to parameterise the conditional dependence between \\(R\\) and \\(Y_{mis}\\), given \\(Y_{obs}\\). Without the benefit of untestable assumptions, this association structure cannot be identified from the observed data and therefore inference depends on some combination of two elements:\nWe show some simple examples about how these nonignorable models can be constructed, identified and applied. In this section, we specifically focus on the class of nonignorable models known as Selection Models(SM)."

Thus, under the SM approach, the response model \\(f(y \\mid \\theta)\\) and the missing data mechanism \\(f(r \\mid y, \\psi)\\) must be specified by the analyst. SMs can be attractive for several reasons, including\n\nThe possibility to directly specify the model of interest \\(f(y \\mid \\theta)\\)\nThe SM factorisation appeals to Rubin’s missing data taxonomy, enabling easy characterisation of the missing data mechanism\nWhen the missingness pattern is monotone, the missigness mechanism can be formulated as a hazard function, where the hazard of dropout at some time point \\(j\\) can depend on parts of the full data vector \\(Y\\)\n\n\nExample of SM for bivariate normal data\nConsider a sample of \\(i=1,\\ldots,n\\) units from a bivariate normal distribution \\(Y=(Y_1,Y_2)\\). Assume also that \\(Y_1\\) is always observed while \\(Y_2\\) may be missing, and let \\(R=R_2\\) be the missingness indicator for the partially-observed response \\(Y_2\\). A SM factors the full data distribution as\n\\[\nf(y_1,y_2,r \\mid \\omega) = f(y_1 \\mid \\theta)f(r \\mid y_1,y_2,\\psi),\n\\]\nwhere we assume \\(\\omega=(\\theta,\\psi)\\). Suppose we specify \\(f(y_1,y_2 \\mid \\theta)\\) as a bivariate normal density with mean \\(\\mu\\) and \\(2\\times2\\) covariance matrix \\(\\Sigma\\). The distribution of \\(r\\) is assumed to be distributed as a Bernoulli variable with probability \\(\\pi_i\\), such that\n\\[\ng(\\pi_i) = \\psi_0 + \\psi_1y_{i1} + \\psi_2y_{i2},\n\\]\nwhere \\(g()\\) denotes a given link function which relates the expected value of the response to the linear predictors in the model. When this is taken as the inverse normal cumulative distribution function \\(\\Phi^{-1}()\\) the model corresponds to the Heckman probit selection model (Heckman (1976)). In general, setting \\(\\psi_2=0\\) leads to a Missing At Random(MAR) assumption; if, in addition, we have distinctness of the parameters \\(f(\\mu,\\Sigma,\\psi)=f(\\mu,\\Sigma)f(\\psi)\\), we have ignorability. We note that, even though the parameter \\(\\psi_2\\) characterises the association between \\(R\\) and \\(Y_2\\), the parametric assumptions made in this example will identify \\(\\psi_2\\) even in the absence of informative priors, that is the observed data likelihood is a function of \\(\\psi_2\\). Moreover, the parameter indexes the joint distribution of observables \\(Y_{obs}\\) and \\(R\\) and in general can be identified from the observed data. This property of parametric SMs make them ill-suited to assessing sensitivity to assumptions about the missingness mechanism.\nThe model can also be generalised to longitudinal data assuming a multivariate normal distribution for \\(Y=(Y_1,\\ldots,Y_J)\\) and replacing \\(\\pi_i\\) with a discrete time hazard function for dropout\n\\[\nh\\left(t_j \\mid \\bar{Y}_{j}\\right) = \\text{Prob}\\left(R_j = 0 \\mid R_{j-1} = 1, Y_{1},\\ldots,Y_{j} \\right).\n\\]\nUsing the logit function to model the discrete time hazard in terms of observed response history \\(\\bar{Y}_{j-1}\\) and the current but possibly unobserved \\(Y_j\\) corresponds to the model of Diggle and Kenward (1994)."

    "text": "Multiple Imputation(MI) refers to the procedure of replacing each missing value by a set of \\(H\\geq 2\\) imputed values. These are ordered in the sense that \\(H\\) completed data sets can be created from the sets of imputations, where the first imputed value replaces the missing value in the first completed data set, the second imputed value in the second completed data set, and so on. Next, standard complete data methods are used to analyse each completed data set. When the \\(H\\) sets of imputations are repeated random draws from the predictive distribution of the missing data under a particular model of missingness, the \\(H\\) completed data inferences can be combined to form one inference that properly reflects uncertainty due to missing values under that model. In general, MI procedures can be summarised in three main steps:\nMi was first proposed by Rubin (Rubin (1978)) and has become more popular over time (Rubin (1996), Schafer and Graham (2002), Little and Rubin (2019)), as well as the focus of research for methodological and practical applications in a variety of fields (Herzog and Rubin (1983), Rubin and Schenker (1987), Schafer (1999), Carpenter and Kenward (2012), Molenberghs et al. (2014), Van Buuren (2018)). MI shares both advantages of Single Imputaiton (SI) methods and solves both disadvantages. Indeed, like SI, MI methods allow the analyst to use familiar complete data methods when analysing the completed data sets. The only disadvantage of MI compared with SI methods is that it takes more time to generate the imputations and analyse the completed data sets. However, Rubin (2004) showed that in order to obtain sufficiently precise estimates, a relatively small number of imputations (typically \\(10\\)) is required. For example, considering a situation with \\(\\lambda=50\\%\\) missing information and \\(H=10\\) imputations, the efficiency of MI can be shown to be equal to \\((1+\\frac{\\lambda}{H})^{-1}=95\\%\\). In addition, in today’s computing environments, the work of analysing the completed data sets is quite modest since it involves performing the same task \\(H\\) times. Thus, once a precedure to combine multiple completed data sets is established, the additonal time and effort to handle \\(50\\), \\(20\\), or \\(10\\) imputations if often of little consequence.\nIn the first step of MI, imputations should ideally be created as repeated draws from the posterior predictive distribution of the missing values \\(y_{mis}\\) given the observed values \\(y_{obs}\\), each repetition being an independent drawing of the parameters and missing values. In practice, implicit imputation models can also be used in place of explicit imputation models (Herzog and Rubin (1983)). In the second step, each completed data set is analysed using the same complete data method that would be used in the absence of missingness. Finally, in the last step, standard procedures should be used to combine the compelted data inferences into a single one. The simplest and most popular method for combining the reuslts of \\(H\\) completed data sets is known as Rubin’s rules (Rubin (2004)), which can be explained with a simple example."

Then, according to Rubin’s rules, the combined estimate is simply the average of the \\(H\\) completed data estimates, that is\n\\[\n\\bar{\\theta}_{H}=\\frac{1}{H}\\sum_{h=1}^{H}\\hat{\\theta}_{h}.\n\\]\nBecause the imputations under MI are conditional draws, under a good imputaton model, they provide valid estimates for a wide range of estimands. In addition, the averaging over \\(H\\) imputed data sets increases the efficiency of estimation over that obtained from a single completed data set. The variability associated with the pooled estimate has two components: the average within-imputation variance \\(\\bar{V}_H\\) and the between-imputation variance \\(B_H\\), defined as\n\\[\n\\bar{V}_{H}=\\frac{1}{H}\\sum_{h=1}^{H}V_{h} \\;\\;\\; \\text{and} \\;\\;\\; B_{H}=\\frac{1}{H-1}\\sum_{h=1}^{H}(\\hat{\\theta}_{h}-\\bar{\\theta}_{H})^2.\n\\]\nThe total variability associated with \\(\\bar{\\theta}_H\\) is the computed as\n\\[\nT_{H}=\\bar{V}_H + \\frac{H+1}{H}B_{H},\n\\]\nwhere \\((1+\\frac{1}{H})\\) is an adjustment factor for finite due to estimating \\(\\theta\\) by \\(\\bar{\\theta}_H\\). Thus, \\(\\hat{\\lambda}_H=(1+\\frac{1}{H})\\frac{B_H}{T_H}\\) is known as the fraction of missing information and is an estimate of the fraction of information about \\(\\theta\\) that is missing due to nonresponse. For large sample sizes and scalar quantities like \\(\\theta\\), the reference distribution for interval estimates and significance tests is a \\(t\\) distribution\n\\[\n(\\theta - \\bar{\\theta}_H)\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{T^2_H}} \\sim t_v,\n\\]\nwhere the degrees of freedom \\(v\\) can be approximated with the quantity \\(v=(H-1)\\left(1+\\frac{1}{H+1}\\frac{\\bar{V}_H}{B_H} \\right)^2\\) (Rubin and Schenker (1987)). In small data sets, an improved version of \\(v\\) can be obtained as \\(v^\\star=(\\frac{1}{v}+\\frac{1}{\\hat{v}_{obs}})^{-1}\\), where\n\\[\n\\hat{v}_{obs}=(1-\\hat{\\lambda}_{H})\\left(\\frac{v_{com}+1}{v_{com}+3}\\right)v_{com},\n\\]\nwith \\(v_{com}\\) being the degrees of freedom for appropriate or exact \\(t\\) inferences about \\(\\theta\\) when there are no missing values (Barnard and Rubin (1999)).\nThe validity of MI rests on how the imputations are created and how that procedure relates to the model used to subsequently analyze the data. Creating MIs often requires special algorithms (Schafer (1997)). In general, they should be drawn from a distribution for the missing data that reflects uncertainty about the parameters of the data model. Recall that with SI methods, it is desirable to impute from the conditional distribution \\(p(y_{mis}\\mid y_{obs},\\hat{\\theta})\\), where \\(\\hat{\\theta}\\) is an estimate derived from the observed data. MI extends this approach by first simulating \\(H\\) independent plausible values for the parameters \\(\\theta_1,\\ldots,\\theta_H\\) and then drawing the missing values \\(y_{mis}^h\\) from \\(p(y_{mis}\\mid y_{obs}, \\theta_h)\\). Treating parameters as random rather than fixed is an essential part of MI. For this reason, it is natural (but not essential) to motivate MI from the Bayesian perspective, in which the state of knowledge about parameters is represented through a posterior distribution."

    "text": "Multiple Imputation by Chained Equations\nMI by Chained Equations, also known as Fully Conditional Specification(FCS), imputes multivariate missing data on a variable-by-variable basis, and therefore requires the specification of an imputation model for each incomplete variable to create imputations per variable in an iterative fashion (Van Buuren (2007)). In contrast to Joint MI, MICE specifies the multivariate distribution for the outcome and missingness pattern \\(p(y,r\\mid \\theta, \\phi)\\), indexed by the parameter vectors of the outcome (\\(\\theta\\)) and missingness models (\\(\\phi\\)), through a set of conditional densities \\(p(y_j \\mid y_{-j},r,\\theta_j, \\phi_j)\\), which is used to impute \\(y_j\\) given the other variables. Starting from a random draw from the marginal distribution of \\(y_1\\), imputation is then carried out by iterating over the conditionally specified imputation models for each \\(y_j=(y_2,\\ldots,y_J)\\) separately given the set of all the other variables \\(y_{-j}\\).\nTha main idea of MICE is to directly draw the missing data from the predictive distribution of conditional densities, therefore avoiding the need to specify a joint multivariate model for all the data. Different approaches can be used to implement MICE. For example, a possible strategy is the following:\n\nStart at iteration \\(t=0\\) by drawing randomly from the the distribution of the missing data given the observed data and all other variables, according to some probability model for each variable \\(y_j\\), that is\n\n\\[\n\\hat{y}^{mis}_{j,0} \\sim p(y^{mis}_{j} \\mid y^{obs}_{j}, y_{-j}, r)\n\\]\n\nAt each iteration \\(t=1,\\ldots,T\\) and for each variable \\(j=\\ldots,J\\), set\n\n\\[\n\\hat{y}^{mis}_{-j,t}=\\left(\\hat{y}_{1,t},\\ldots, \\hat{y}_{j-1,t}, \\hat{y}_{j+1,t}, \\ldots, \\hat{y}_{J,t} \\right)\n\\]\nas the currently completed data except \\(y_j\\)\n\nDraw \\(h=1,\\ldots,H\\) imputations for each variable \\(y_j\\) from the predictive distribution of the missing data given the observed data and the currently imputed data at \\(t\\), that is\n\n\\[\n\\hat{y}^{mis}_{j,t} \\sim p(y^{mis}_{j} \\mid y^{obs}_{j}, \\hat{y}_{-j,t}, r)\n\\]\nand repeat the steps 2 and 3 until convergence. It is important to stress out that MICE is essentially a Markov Chain Monte Carlo(MCMC) algorithm (Brooks et al. (2011)), where the state space is the collection of all imputed values. More specifically, when the conditional distributions of all variables are compatible with a joint multivariate distribution, the algorithm corresponds to a Gibbs sampler, a Bayesian simulation method that samples from the conditional distributions in order to obtain samples from the joint multivariate distribution of all variables via some conditional factorisation of the latter (Casella and George (1992), Gilks, Richardson, and Spiegelhalter (1996)). A potential issue of MICE is that, since the conditional distributions are specified freely by the user, these may not be compatible with a joint distribution and therefore it is not clear from which distribution the algorithm is sampling from. However, a general advatage of MICE is that it gives freedom to the user for the specification of the univariate models for the variables, which can be tailored to handle different types of variabes (e.g. continuous and categorical) and different statistical issues for each variable (e.g. skewness and non-liner associations).\nRegardless of the theoretical implications of MICE, as a MCMC method, the algorithm converges to a stationary distribution when three conditions are satisfied (Roberts (1996),Brooks et al. (2011)):\n\nThe chain is irreducible, i.e. must be able to reach any state from any state in the state space\nThe chain is aperiodic, i.e. must be able to return to each state after some unknown number of steps or transitions\nThe chain is recurrent, i.e. there is probability of one of eventually returning to each state after some number of steps\n\nTypically periodicity and non-recurrence can be a problem in MICE when the imputation models are not compatible, possibly leading to different inferences based on the stopping point of the chain or to non-stationary behaviours of the chain."

    "text": "As for the inference under complete data, inference under incomplete data consists in deriving the likelihood for the parameters based on the available data, either using a Maximum Likelihood (ML) approach (solving the likelihood equation) or using the Bayes’ rule incorporating a prior distribution (performing necessary integrations to obtain the posterior distribution). However, asymptotic standard errors obtained from the information matrix, are more questionable when dealing with missing data since the sample will not be typically iid and results that imply the large sample normality of the likelihood function do not immediately apply. More complications arise when dealing with the process that lead to some of the data to be missing. This can be explained with a simple example.\nLet \\(Y=(y_{ij})\\), for \\(i=1,\\ldots,n\\) and \\(j=1,\\ldots,J\\), denote the complete dataset if there were no missing values, with a total of \\(n\\) units and \\(J\\) variables. Let \\(M=(m_{ij})\\) denote the fully observed matrix of binary missing data indicators with \\(m_{ij}=1\\) if \\(y_{ij}\\) is missing and \\(0\\) otherwise. As an example, we can model the density of the joint distribution of \\(Y\\) and \\(M\\) using the selection model factorisation (Little and Rubin (2019))\n\\[\np(Y=y,M=m \\mid \\theta, \\psi) = f(y \\mid \\theta)f(m \\mid y, \\psi),\n\\]\nwhere \\(\\theta\\) is the parameter vector indexing the response model and \\(\\psi\\) is the parameter vector indexing the missingness mechanism. The observed values \\(m\\) effect a partition \\(y=(y_1,y_0)\\), where \\(y_0=[y_{ij} : m_{ij}=0]\\) is the observed component and \\(y_1=[y_{ij} : m_{ij}=1]\\) is the missing component of \\(y\\).

Next, we define the likelihood of ignoring the missingness mechanism or ignorable likelihood as\n\\[\nL_{ign}\\left(\\theta \\mid y_{0} \\right) = \\int f(y_{0},y_{1}\\mid \\theta)dy_{1},\n\\]\nwhich does not involve the model for \\(M\\). In practice, modelling the joint distribution of \\(Y\\) and \\(M\\) is often challenging and, in fact, many approaches to missing data do not model \\(M\\) and (explicitly or implicitly) base inference about \\(\\theta\\) on the ignorable likelihood. It is therefore important to assess under which conditions inferences about \\(\\theta\\) based on \\(L_{ign}\\) can be considered appropriate. More specifically, the missingness mechanism is said to be ignorable if inferences about \\(\\theta\\) based on the ignorable likelihood equation evauluated at some realisations of \\(y_0\\) and \\(m\\) are the same as inferences about \\(\\theta\\) based on the full likelihood equation, evaluated at the same realisations of \\(y_0\\) and \\(m\\). The conditions for ignoring the missingness mechanism depend on whether the inferences are direct likelihood, Bayesian or frequentist."

The proprties of \\(bar{y}_{HD}\\) depend on the procedure used to generate the numbers \\(H_i\\) and in general the mean and sampling variance of this estimator can be written as\n\\[\nE[\\bar{y}_{HD}]=E[E[\\bar{y}_{HD}\\mid y_{obs}]] \\;\\;\\; \\text{and} \\;\\;\\; Var(\\bar{y}_{HD})=Var(E[\\bar{y}_{HD} \\mid y_{obs}]) + E[Var(\\bar{y}_{HD} \\mid y_{obs})],\n\\]\nwhere the inner expectations and variances are taken over the distribution of \\(H_i\\) given the observed data \\(y_{obs}\\), and the outer expectations and variances are taken over the model distribution of \\(y\\). The term \\(E[Var(\\bar{y}_{HD} \\mid y_{obs})]\\) represents the additional sampling variance from the stochastic imputation procedure. Examples of these procedures include predictive mean matching or PMM(Little and Rubin (2019)) and last value carried forward or LVCF(Little and Rubin (2019)).\n\nPredictive Mean Matching\nA general approach to hot-deck imputation is to define a metric \\(d(i,j)\\) measuring the distance between units based on observed variables \\(x_{i1},\\ldots,x_{iJ}\\) and then choose the imputed values that come from responding units close to the unit with the missing value, i.e. we choose the imputed value for \\(y_i\\) from a donor pool of units \\(j\\) that are such that \\(y_j,x_1,\\ldots,x_J\\) are observed and \\(d(i,j)\\) is less than some value \\(d_0\\). Varying the value for \\(d_0\\) can control the number of available donors \\(j\\). When the choice of the metric has the form\n\\[\nd(i,j)=(\\hat{y}(x_i)-\\hat{y}(x_j))^2,\n\\]\nwhere \\(\\hat{y}(x_i)\\) is the predicted value of \\(y\\) from the regression of \\(y\\) on \\(x\\) from the complete units, then the procedure is known as PMM. A powerful aspect of this metric is that it weights predictors according to their ability to predict the missing variable, which allows to have some protection against misspecification of the regression of \\(y\\) on \\(x\\), even though better approaches are available when good matches to donor units cannot be found or the sample size is small.\n\n\nLast Value Carried Forward\nLongitudinal data are often subject to attrition when units leave the study prematurely. Let \\(y_i=(y_{i1},\\ldots,y_{iJ})\\) be a \\((J\\times1)\\) vector of partially-observed outcomes for subject \\(i\\), and denote with \\(y_{i,obs}\\) and \\(y_{i,mis}\\) the observed and missing components of \\(y_i\\), i.e. \\(y=(y_{i,obs},y_{i,mis})\\). Define the indicator variable \\(m_i\\) taking value 0 for complete units and \\(j\\) if subject \\(i\\) drops out between \\(j-1\\) and \\(j\\) time points. LVCF, also called last observation carried forward(Pocock (2013)), imputes all missing values for individual \\(i\\) (for whom \\(m_i=j\\)) using the last recorded value for that unit, that is\n\\[\n\\hat{y}_{it}=y_{i,j-1},\n\\]\nwhere \\(t=j,\\ldots,J\\). Although simple, this approach makes the often unrealistic assumption that the value of the outcome remains unchanged after dropout."

    "text": "MLE estimation\nFinding the maximum value of \\(\\theta\\) that is most likely to have generated the data \\(y\\), corresponding to maximising the likelihood or Maximum Likelihood Estimation(MLE), is a standard approach to make inference about \\(\\theta\\). Suppose a specific value for the parameter \\(\\hat{\\theta}\\) such that \\(L(\\hat{\\theta}\\mid y)\\geq L(\\theta \\mid y)\\) for any other value of \\(\\theta\\). This implies that the observed data \\(y\\) is at least as likely under \\(\\hat{\\theta}\\) as under any other value of \\(\\theta\\), i.e. \\(\\hat{\\theta}\\) is the value best supported by the data. More specifically, a maximum likelihood estimate of \\(\\theta\\) is a value of \\(\\theta \\in \\Theta\\) that maximises the likelihood \\(L(\\theta \\mid y)\\) or, equivalently, that maximises the loglikelihood \\(l(\\theta \\mid y)\\). In general, when the likelihood is differentiable and bounded from above, typically the MLE can be found by differentiating \\(L(\\theta \\mid y)\\) or \\(l(\\theta \\mid y)\\) with respect to \\(\\theta\\), setting the result equal to zero, and solving for \\(\\theta\\). The resulting equation, \\(D_l(\\theta)=\\frac{\\partial l(\\theta \\mid y)}{\\partial \\theta}=0\\), is known as the likelihood equation and the derivative of the loglikelihood as the score function. When \\(\\theta\\) consists in a set of \\(j=1,\\ldots,J\\) components, then the likelihood equation corresponds to a set of \\(J\\) simultaneous equations, obtained by differentiating \\(l(\\theta \\mid y)\\) with respect to each component of \\(\\theta\\).\n\nUnivariate Normal Example\nRecall that, for a Normal sample with \\(n\\) units, the loglikelihood is indexed by the set of parameters \\(\\theta=(\\mu,\\sigma^2)\\) and has the form\n\\[\nl(\\mu, \\sigma^2 \\mid y)= -\\frac{n}{2}\\text{ln}(2\\pi)-\\frac{n}{2}\\text{ln}(\\sigma^2)-\\frac{1}{2}\\sum_{i=1}^n \\frac{(y_i-\\mu)^2}{\\sigma^2}.\n\\]\nNext, the MLE can be derived by first differentiating \\(l(\\theta \\mid y)\\) with respect to \\(\\mu\\) and set the result equal to zero, that is\n\\[\n\\frac{\\partial l(\\theta \\mid y)}{\\partial \\mu}= -\\frac{2}{2\\sigma^2}\\sum_{i=1}^n(y_i-\\mu)(-1)=\\frac{\\sum_{i=1}^n y_i - n\\mu}{\\sigma^2}=0,\n\\]\nNext, after simplifying a bit, we can retrieve the solution\n\\[\n\\hat{\\mu}=\\frac{1}{n}\\sum_{i=1}^n y_i=\\bar{y},\n\\]\nwhich corresponds to the sample mean of the observations. Next, we differentiate \\(l(\\theta \\mid y)\\) with respect to \\(\\sigma^2\\), that is we set\n\\[\n\\frac{\\partial l(\\theta \\mid y)}{\\partial \\sigma^2}= -\\frac{n}{2\\sigma^2}+\\frac{1}{2(\\sigma^2)^2}\\sum_{i=1}^n (y_i-\\mu)^2=0.\n\\]\nWe then simplify and move things around to get\n\\[\n\\frac{1}{\\sigma^3}\\sum_{i=1}^n(y_i-\\mu)^2=\\frac{n}{\\sigma} \\;\\;\\; \\rightarrow \\;\\;\\;  \\sigma^2=\\frac{1}{n}\\sum\\_{i=1}^n(y_i-\\mu)^2.\n\\]\nFinally, we replace \\(\\mu\\) in the expression above with the value \\(\\hat{\\mu}=\\bar{y}\\) found before and obtain the solution\n\\[\n\\hat{\\sigma}^2=\\frac{1}{n}\\sum_{i=1}^n(y_i-\\bar{y})^2=s^2,\n\\]\nwhich, however, is a biased estimator of \\(\\sigma^2\\) and therefore is often replaced with the unbiased estimator \\(\\frac{s^2}{(n-1)}\\). In particular, given a population parameter \\(\\theta\\), the estimator \\(\\hat{\\theta}\\) for \\(\\theta\\) is said to be unbiased when \\(E[\\hat{\\theta}]=\\theta\\). This is the case, for example, of the sample mean \\(\\hat{\\mu}=\\bar{y}\\) which is an unbiased estimator of the population mean \\(\\mu\\):\n\\[\nE\\left[\\hat{\\mu} \\right]=E\\left[\\frac{1}{n}\\sum_{i=1}^n y_i \\right]=\\frac{1}{n}\\sum_{i=1}^n E\\left[y_i \\right]=\\frac{1}{n} (n\\mu)=\\mu.\n\\]\nHowever, this is not true for the sample variance \\(s^2\\). This can be seen by first rewriting the expression of the estimator as\n\\[\n\\hat{\\sigma}^2=\\frac{1}{n}\\sum_{i=1}^n (y_i^2 -2y_i\\bar{y}+\\bar{y}^2)=\\frac{1}{n}\\sum_{i=1}^n y_i^2 -2\\bar{y}\\sum_{i=1}^n y_i + \\frac{1}{n}n\\bar{y}^2=\\frac{1}{n}\\sum_{i=1}^n y_i^2 - \\bar{y}^2,\n\\]\nand then by computing the expectation of this quantity:\n\\[\nE\\left[\\hat{\\sigma}^2 \\right]=E\\left[\\frac{1}{n}\\sum_{i=1}^n y_i^2 - \\bar{y}^2 \\right]=\\frac{1}{n}\\sum_{i=1}^n E\\left[y_i^2 \\right] - E\\left[\\bar{y}^2 \\right]=\\frac{1}{n}\\sum_{i=1}^n (\\sigma^2 + \\mu^2) - (\\frac{\\sigma^2}{n}+\\mu^2)=\\frac{1}{n}\\left(n\\sigma^2+n\\mu^2\\right) - \\frac{\\sigma^2}{n}-\\mu^2=\\frac{(n-1)\\sigma^2}{n}.\n\\]\nThe above result is obtained by pluggin in the expression for the variance of a general variable \\(y\\) and retrieving the expression for \\(E[y^2]\\) as a function of the variance and \\(E[y]^2\\). More specifically, given that\n\\[\nVar(y)=\\sigma^2=E\\left[y^2 \\right]-E\\left[y \\right]^2,\n\\]\nthen we know that for \\(y\\), \\(E\\left[y^2 \\right]=\\sigma^2+E[y]^2\\), and similarly we can derive the same expression for \\(\\bar{y}\\). However, we can see that \\(\\hat{\\sigma}^2\\) is biased by a factor of \\((n-1)/n\\). Thus, an unbiased estimator for \\(\\sigma^2\\) is given by multiplying \\(\\hat{\\sigma}^2\\) by \\(\\frac{n}{(n-1)}\\), which gives the unbiased estimator \\(\\hat{\\sigma}^{2\\star}=\\frac{s^2}{n-1}\\), where \\(E\\left[\\hat{\\sigma}^{2\\star}\\right]=\\sigma^2\\).\n\n\nMultivariate Normal Example\nThe same procedure can be applied to an independent and identically distributed multivariate sample \\(y=(y_{ij})\\), for \\(i=1,\\ldots,n\\) units and \\(j=1,\\ldots,J\\) variables (Anderson (1962),Rao et al. (1973),Gelman et al. (2013)). It can be shown that, maximising the loglikelihood with respect to \\(\\mu\\) and \\(\\Sigma\\) yields the MLEs\n\\[\n\\hat{\\mu}=\\bar{y} \\;\\;\\; \\text{and} \\;\\;\\; \\Sigma=\\frac{(n-1)\\hat{\\sigma}^{2\\star}}{n},\n\\]\nwhere \\(\\bar{y}=(\\bar{y}_1,\\ldots,\\bar{y}_{J})\\) is the row vectors of sample means and \\(\\hat{\\sigma}^{2\\star}=(s^{\\star_{jk}})\\) is the sample covariance matrix with \\(jk\\)-th element \\(s^\\star_{jk}=\\frac{\\Sigma_{i=1}^n(y_{ij} - \\bar{y}_j)}{(n-1)}\\). In addition, in general, given a function \\(g(\\theta)\\) of the parameter \\(\\theta\\), if \\(\\hat{\\theta}\\) is a MLE of \\(\\theta\\), then \\(g(\\hat{\\theta})\\) is a MLE of \\(g(\\theta)\\)."

The imputation distorts the empirical distribution of the observed values as well as any quantities that are not linear in the data (e.g. variances, percentiles, measures of shape). The sampel covariance of \\(y_j\\) and \\(y_k\\) from the imputed data is\n\\[\ns^{m}_{jk}=s^{ac}_{jk}\\frac{(n^{as}_{jk}-1)}{(n-1)},\n\\]\nwhere \\(n^{ac}_{jk}\\) is the number of units with both variables observed and \\(s^{ac}_{jk}\\) is the corresponding covariance estimate from ACA. Under MCAR \\(s^{ac}_{jk}\\) is a consistent estimator of the true covariance, so that \\(s^{m}_{jk}\\) underestimates the magnitude of the covariance by a factor of \\(\\frac{(n^{ac}_{jk}-1)}{(n-1)}\\). Obvious adjustments for the variance (\\(\\frac{(n-1)}{(n^{ac}_j-1)}\\)) and the covariance (\\(\\frac{(n-1)}{(n^{ac}_{jk}-1)}\\)) yield ACA estimates, which could lead to covariance matrices that are not positive definite."

    "text": "Regression Imputation\nAn improvement over SI-M is to impute each missing data using the conditional means given the observed values, a method known SI-R or Conditional Mean Imputation. To be precise, it would also be possible to impute conditional means without using a regression approach, for example by grouping individuals into adjustment classes (analogous to weighting methods) based on the observed data and then impute the missing values using the observed means in each adjustment class (Little and Rubin (2019)). However, for the sake of simplicity, here we will assume that SI-R and conditional mean imputation are the same.\nTo generate imputations under SI-R, consider a set of \\(J-1\\) fully observed response variables \\(y_1,\\ldots,y_{J-1}\\) and a partially observed response variable \\(y_J\\) which has the first \\(n_{cc}\\) units observed and the remaiing \\(n-n_{cc}\\) units missing. SI-R computes the regression of \\(y_J\\) on \\(y_1,\\ldots,y_{J-1}\\) based on the \\(n_{cc}\\) complete units and then fills in the missing values as predictions from the regression. For example, for unit \\(i\\), the missing value \\(y_{iJ}\\) is imputed using\n\\[\n\\hat{y}_{iJ}=\\hat{\\beta}_{J0}+\\sum_{j=1}^{J-1}\\hat{\\beta}_{Jj}y_{ij},\n\\]\nwhere \\(\\hat{\\beta}_{J0}\\) is the intercept and \\(\\hat{\\beta}_{Jj}\\) is the \\(j\\) coefficient of of the regression of \\(y_J\\) on \\(y_1,\\ldots,y_{J-1}\\) based on the \\(n_{cc}\\) units.\nAn extension of regression imputation to a general pattern of missing data is known as Buck’s method (Buck (1960)). This approach first estimates the population mean \\(\\mu\\) and covariance matrix \\(\\Sigma\\) from the sample mean and covariance matrix of the complete units and then uses these estimates to calculate the OLS regressions of the missing variables on the observed variables for each missing data pattern. Predictions of the missing data for each observation are obtained by replacing the values of the present variables in the regressions. The average of the observed and imputed values from this method are consistent estimates of the means and MCAR and mild assumptions about the moments of the distribution (Buck (1960)). They are also consistent when the missingness mechanism depends on observed variables, i.e. under a Missing At Random(MAR) assumption, although addtional assumptions are required in this case (e.g. using linear regressions it assumes that the “true” regression of the missing varables on the observed variables is linear).\nThe filled in data from Buck’s method typically yield reasonable estimates of means, while the sample variances and covariances are biased, although the bias is less than the one associated with unconditional mean imputation. Specifically, the sample variance \\(\\sigma^{2,SI-R}_j\\) from the imputed data underestimates the true variance \\(\\sigma^2_j\\) by a factor of \\(\\frac{1}{n-1}\\sum_{i=1}^n\\sigma^{2}_{ji}\\), where \\(\\sigma^{2}_{ji}\\) is the residual variance from regressing \\(y_j\\) on the variables observed in unit \\(i\\) if \\(y_{ij}\\) is missing and zero if \\(y_{ij}\\) is observed. The sample covariance of \\(y_j\\) and \\(y_k\\) has a bias of \\(\\frac{1}{n-1}\\sum_{i=1}^n\\sigma_{jki}\\), where \\(\\sigma_{jki}\\) is the residual covariance from the multivariate regression of \\((y_{ij},y_{ik})\\) on the variables observed in unit \\(i\\) if both variables are missing and zero otherwise. A consistent estimator of \\(\\Sigma\\) can be constructed under MCAR by replacing consistent estimates of \\(\\sigma^{2}_{ji}\\) and \\(\\sigma_{jki}\\) in the expressions for bias and then adding the resulting quantities to the sample covariance matrix of the filled-in data."

    "text": "Stochastic Regression Imputation\nAny type of mean or regression imputation will lead to bias when the interest is in the tails of the distributions because “best prediction” imputation systematically underestimates variability and standard errors calculated from the imputed data are typically too small. These considerations suggest an alternative imputation strategy, where imputed values are drawn from a predictive distribution of a plausible set of values rather than from the centre of the distribution. This is the idea behind SI-SR, which imputes a conditional draw\n\\[\n\\hat{y}_{iJ}=\\hat{\\beta}_{J0}+\\sum_{j=1}^{J-1}\\hat{\\beta}_{Jj}y_{ij}+z_{iJ},\n\\]\nwhere \\(z_{iJ}\\) is a random normal deviate with mean 0 and variance \\(\\hat{\\sigma}^2_J\\), the residual variance from the regression of \\(y_J\\) on \\(y_1,\\ldots,y_{J-1}\\) based on the complete units. The addition of the random deviate makes the imputation a random draw from the predictive distribution of the missing values, rather than the mean, which is likely to ameliorate the distortion of the predictive distributions (Little and Rubin (2019)).\n\nExample\nConsider a bivariate normal monotone missing data with \\(y_1\\) fully observed and \\(y_2\\) missing for a fraction \\(\\lambda=\\frac{(n-n_{cc})}{n}\\) and a MCAR mechanism. The following table shows the large sample bias of standard OLS estimates obtained from the filled-in data about the mean, the variance of \\(y_2\\), the regression coefficient of \\(y_2\\) on \\(y_1\\), and the regression coefficient of \\(y_1\\) on \\(y_2\\), using four different single imputation methods: uncondtional mean (UM), unconditional draw (UD), conditional mean (CM), and conditional draw (CD).\n\nBivariate normal monotone MCAR data; large sample bias of four imputation methods.\n\n\n\nmu_2\nsigma_2\nbeta_21\nbeta_12\n\n\n\n\nUM\n0\n-lambda * sigma_2\n-lambda * beta_21\n0\n\n\nUD\n0\n0\n-lambda * beta_21\n-lambda * beta_21\n\n\nCM\n0\n-lambda * (1-rho^2) * sigma_2\n0\n((lambda * (1-rho^2)) / (1-lambda * (1-rho^2)) ) * beta_12\n\n\nCD\n0\n0\n0\n0\n\n\n\n\n\nUnder MCAR, all four methods yield consistent estimates of \\(\\mu_2\\) but both UM and CM underestimate the variance \\(\\sigma_2\\), UD leads to attenuation of the regression coefficients, while CD yields consistent estimates of all four parameters. However, CD has some important drawbacks. First, adding random draws to the conditional mean imputations is inefficient as the large sample variance of the CD estimates of \\(\\mu_2\\) can be shown (Little and Rubin (2019)) to be\n\\[\n\\frac{[1-\\lambda\\rho^2+(1-\\rho^2)\\lambda(1-\\lambda)]\\sigma_2}{n_{cc}},\n\\]\nwhich is larger than the large sample sampling variance of the CM estimate of \\(\\mu_2\\), namely \\(\\frac{[1-\\lambda\\rho^2]\\sigma_2}{n_{cc}}\\). Second, the standard errors of the CD estimates from the imputed data are too small because they do not incorporate imputation uncertainty.\nWhen the analysis involves units with some covariates missing and other observed, it is common practice to condition on the observed covariates when generating the imputations for the missing covariates. It is also possible to condition on the outcome \\(y\\) to impute missing covariates, even if the final objective is to regress \\(y\\) on the full set of covariates and conditioning on \\(y\\) will lead to bias when conditional means are imputed. However, if predictive draws are imputed, this approach will yield consistent estimates of the regression coefficients. Imputing missing covariates using the means by conditioning only the observed covariates (and not also on \\(y\\)) also yields consistent estimates of the regression coefficients under certain conditions, although these are typically less efficient then those from CCA, but yields inconsistent estimates of other parameters such as variances and correlations (Little (1992))."

    "text": "Complete case analysis (CCA), also known as case or listwise deletion (LD), is one of the oldest methods to handle missing data and consists in discarding any unit or case whose information is incomplete. Only the cases with observed values for all the variables under consideration are used in the analysis. For example, suppose we have a data set formed by \\(i=1,\\ldots,n\\) individuals and that we want to fit a linear regression on some outcome variable \\(y_i\\) using some other variables \\(x_{i1},\\ldots,x_{ik}\\) as covariates. CCA uses only the subset of cases with observed values on all the variables included in the analysis (completers).\nCCA has been a quite popular approach to deal with missingness, mainly because it is very easy to implement (used by default in many statistical programs) and it allows the comparison of different univariate statistics in a straightforward way (calculated on a common set of cases). However, there are a number of potential disadvantages which threatens the validity of this method:\n\nBias, when the missing data mechanism is not missing completely at random (MCAR) and the completers are not a random samples of all the cases\nLoss of efficiency, due to the potential loss of information in discarding the incomplete cases.\n\nCCA may be justified when the loss of precision and bias are minimal, which is more likley to occur when the proportion of completers is high, although it is difficult to formulate rules that apply in general circumstances. Indeed, both the degree of loss of precision and bias depend not only on the fraction of completers and missingness patterns, but also on the extent to which complete and incomplete cases differ and the parameters of interest.\nLet \\(\\hat{\\theta}_{cc}\\) be an estimate of a parameter of interest from the completers. One might measure the increase in variance of \\(\\hat{\\theta}_{cc}\\) with respect to the estimate \\(\\hat{\\theta}\\) that would be obtained in the absence of missing values. Using the notation of Little and Rubin (2019):\n\\[\n\\text{Var}(\\hat{\\theta}_{cc}) = \\text{Var}(\\hat{\\theta})(1 + \\Delta^{\\star}_{cc}),\n\\]\nwhere \\(\\Delta^{\\star}_{cc}\\) is the proportional increase in variance from the loss of information. A more practical measure of the loss of inofrmation is \\(\\Delta_{cc}\\), where\n\\[\n\\text{Var}(\\hat{\\theta}_{cc}) = \\text{Var}(\\hat{\\theta}_{eff})(1 + \\Delta_{cc}),\n\\]\nand \\(\\hat{\\theta}_{eff}\\) is an efficient estimate based on all the available data.\n\n\nConsider bivariate normal monotone data \\(\\bf y = (y_1,y_2)\\), where \\(n_{cc}\\) out of \\(n\\) cases are complete and \\(n - n_{cc}\\) cases have observed values only on \\(y_1\\).

Then, the loss in sample size for estimating the mean of \\(y_1\\) is:\n\\[\n\\Delta_{cc}(\\bar{y}_1) = \\frac{n - n_{cc}}{n_{cc}},\n\\]\nso that if half the cases are missing, the variance is doubled. For the mean of \\(y_2\\), the loss of information alos depends on the squared correlation \\(\\rho^{2}\\) between the variables: (Little and Rubin (2019))\n\\[\n\\Delta_{cc}(\\bar{y}_2) \\approx \\frac{(n - n_{cc})\\rho^{2}}{n_{cc}(1 - \\rho^{2}) + n_{cc}\\rho^{2}}.\n\\]\n\\(\\Delta_{cc}(\\bar{y}_2)\\) varies from zero (when \\(\\rho=0\\)) to \\(\\Delta_{cc}(\\bar{y}_1)\\) as \\(\\rho^{2} \\rightarrow 1\\).

Thus, we can specify a model \\(m(z,\\xi)\\) for \\(\\text{E}[y \\mid z]\\), indexed by the parameter \\(\\xi\\), that can be estimated from the completers. If \\(y\\) is continuous, a simple choice is to estimate \\(\\hat{\\xi}\\) by OLS from the completers. The AIPW estimator for \\(\\mu\\) then becomes\n\\[\n\\mu_{aipw}=\\frac{1}{n}\\sum_{i=1}^n \\left(\\frac{c_iy_i}{\\pi(z_i\\mid \\hat{\\alpha})} -  \\frac{c_i - \\pi(z_i\\mid \\hat{\\alpha})}{\\pi(z_i\\mid \\hat{\\alpha})} m(z_i\\mid \\hat{\\xi}) \\right).\n\\]\nIt can be shown that this estimator is more efficient that the simple IPW complete case estimator for \\(\\mu\\) and that it has a double robustness property. This ensures that \\(\\mu_{aipw}\\) is a consitent estimator of \\(\\mu\\) if either\n\nthe model \\(\\pi(z\\mid\\alpha)\\) is correctly specified, or\nthe model \\(m(z\\mid \\xi)\\) is correctly specified.\n\nTo see a derivation of the double robustness property I put here a link to some nice paper."

However, semiparametric estimators can be less efficient and less powerful than Maximum Likelihood or Bayesian estimators under a well specified parametric model. With missing data, Rubin (1976) results show that likelihood-based methods perform uniformly well over any Missing At Random (MAR) missingness distribution, and the user does not need to specify that distribution. However, semiparametric methods that relax assumptions about the data must in turn assume a specific form for the distribution of missingness. It has been argued that, for these semiparametric methods to gain a substantial advantage over well-specified likelihood methods, the parametric model has to be grossly misspecified (Meng (2000))."

For example, one can compute pairwise sample covariances as:\n\\[\ns^{ac}_{jk} = \\frac{\\sum_{i \\in I_{ac}}(y_{ij}-\\bar{y}_{j}^{ac})(y_{ik}-\\bar{y}_{k}^{ac})}{(n_{ac}-1)},\n\\]\nwhere \\(I_{ac}\\) is the set of \\(n_{ac}\\) with both \\(y_j\\) and \\(y_k\\) observed, while the sample means \\(\\bar{y}^{ac}_{j}\\) and \\(\\bar{y}^{ac}_{k}\\) are calculated over this set of units. We can also estimate the sample correlation\n\\[\nr^{\\star}_{jk} = \\frac{s^{ac}_{jk}}{\\sqrt{s^2_{j}s^{2}_{k}}},\n\\]\nwhere \\(s^2_{j}\\) and \\(s^2_{k}\\) are the sample variances computed over the sets of observed units \\(I_{j}\\) and \\(I_{k}\\), respectively. A problem of this type of correlation estimate is that it can lie outside the range \\((-1,1)\\), which is typically addressed by computing pairwise correlations (Wilks (1932)), where variances are estimated from the set of units with both variables observed \\(I_{jk}\\), i.e. \n\\[\nr^{ac}_{jk} = \\frac{s^{ac}_{jk}}{\\sqrt{s^{2,ac}_{j}s^{2,ac}_{k}}}.\n\\]\nIn addition, we could also replace the sample means \\(\\bar{y}^{ac}_{j}\\) and \\(\\bar{y}^{ac}_{k}\\), evaluated on the common set of units \\(I_{jk}\\), with \\(\\bar{y}_{j}\\) and \\(\\bar{y}_{k}\\), which are evaluated on the sets of units \\(I_{j}\\) and \\(I_{k}\\), respectively. This leads to the following estimates for the sample covariances (Matthai (1951)):\n\\[\ns^{\\star}_{jk} = \\frac{\\sum_{i \\in I_{ac}}(y_{ij}-\\bar{y}_{j})(y_{ik}-\\bar{y}_{k})}{(n_{ac}-1)},\n\\]\nPairwise AC estimates aim at recovering information from partially-observed units that are lost by CCA. However, when considered together, the estimates suffer from inconsistencies that undermine the validity of these methods. For example, pairwise correlation matrices may be not positive definite. Because parameters are estimated from different sets of units, different approaches can be used to obtain estimate of the measures of uncertainty (Schafer and Graham (2002))."

The procedure can be shown to eventually yield a draw from the joint posterior of \\(Y_1\\) and \\(\\theta\\) given \\(Y_0\\), in the sense that as \\(t\\) tends to infinity this sequence converges to a draw from the joint distribution.\n\nBivariate Normal Data Example\nSuppose having a sample \\(y_i=(y_{1i},y_{2i})\\) from a Bivariate Normal distribution for \\(i=1,\\ldots,n\\) units, with mean vector \\(\\mu=(\\mu_1,\\mu_2)\\) and \\(2\\times2\\) covariance matrix \\(\\Sigma\\). Assume that one group of units has \\(Y_1\\) observed and \\(Y_2\\) missing, while a second group of units has both variables observed and a third group of units has \\(Y_1\\) missing and \\(Y_2\\) observed. Under DA methods, each iteration \\(t\\) consists of an I step and a P step. In the first, missing data are replaced with draws from its conditional distribution given the observed data and current values of the parameters (rather then its conditional mean as in the EM algorithm). Because units are conditionally independent given the parameters, each missing \\(y_{2i}\\) is drawn independently as\n\\[\ny_{2i,t+1} \\sim N\\left(\\beta_{20t} + \\beta_{21t}y_{1i}, \\sigma^2_{2t}  \\right),\n\\]\nwhere \\(\\beta_{20t},\\beta_{21t}\\) and \\(\\sigma^2_{2t}\\) are the \\(t\\)-th iterates of the regression parameters of \\(Y_2\\) on \\(Y_1\\). Analogously, each missing \\(y_{1i}\\) is drawn independently as\n\\[\ny_{1i,t+1} \\sim N\\left(\\beta_{10t} + \\beta_{11t}y_{2i}, \\sigma^2_{1t}  \\right),\n\\]\nwhere \\(\\beta_{10t},\\beta_{11t}\\) and \\(\\sigma^2_{1t}\\) are the \\(t\\)-th iterates of the regression parameters of \\(Y_1\\) on \\(Y_2\\). In the second step, these drawn values are treated as if they were the observed values and one draw of the bivariate Normal parameters is made from the complete data posterior. In the limit, the draws are from the joint posterior of the missing values and the parameters. Thus, a run of DA generates both a draw from the posterior predictive distribution of \\(Y_1\\) and a draw from the posterior of \\(\\theta\\), and the procedure can be run \\(D\\) times to obtain \\(D\\) iid draws from the joint posterior of \\(\\theta\\) and \\(Y_1\\). Unlike the EM, estimates of the sampling covariance matrix from the filled-in data can be computed without any corrections to the estimated variances because draws from the posterior predictive distribution of the missing values are imputed in the I step of DA, rather than the conditional means as in the E step of EM. The loss of efficiency from imputing draws is limited when the posterior mean from DA is computed over many draws from the posterior."

    "text": "Assessing Convergence\nAssessing convergence of the sequence of draws to the target distribution is more difficult than assessing convergence of an EM-type algorithm because there is no single target quantity to monitor like the maximum value of the likelihood. Methods have been proposed to assess convergence of a single sequence (Geyer (1992)), but a more reliable approach is to simulate \\(D&gt;1\\) sequences with starting values dispersed throughout the parameter space, and the convergence of all quantities of interest can then be monitored by comparing variation between and within simulated sequences, until the “within” variation roughly equals the “between” variation. The idea is that when the distribution of each simulated sequence is close enough to the distribution of all the sequences mixed together, they can all be approximating the target distribution. Gelman and Rubin (1992) developed an explicit monitoring statistic based on the following idea. For each scalar estimand \\(\\psi\\), label the draws from \\(D\\) parallel sequences as \\(\\psi^d_{t}\\), for \\(t=1,\\ldots,T\\) iterations and \\(d=1,\\ldots,D\\) sequences, and compute the between \\(B\\) and within \\(\\bar{V}\\) sequence variances as:\n\\[\nB=\\frac{T}{D-1}\\sum_{d=1}^D(\\bar{\\psi}_{d.} - \\bar{\\psi}_{..})^2, \\;\\;\\; \\text{and} \\;\\;\\; \\bar{V}=\\frac{1}{D}\\sum_{d=1}^D s^2_{d},\n\\]\nwhere \\(\\bar{\\psi}_{d.}=\\frac{1}{T}\\sum_{t=1}^T \\psi_{dt}\\), \\(\\bar{\\psi}_{..}=\\frac{1}{D}\\sum_{d=1}^D \\bar{\\psi}_{d}\\), and \\(s^2_{d}=\\frac{1}{T-1}\\sum_{t=1}^T(\\psi_{dt} - \\bar{\\psi}_{d.})^2\\). We can then estimate the marginal posterior variance of the estimand as\n\\[\n\\widehat{Var}(\\psi \\mid Y_0) = \\frac{T-1}{T}\\hat{V} + \\frac{1}{T} B,\n\\]\nwhich will overestimate the marginal posterior variance assuming the starting distribution is appropriately over-dispersed but is unbiased under stationarity (starting distribution equals the target distribution). For any finte \\(T\\), the within variance \\(\\hat{V}\\) will underestimate the marginal variance because individual sequences have not had time to range over all the target distribution and should have smaller variance then B. In the limit as \\(T \\rightarrow \\infty\\) the expecation of \\(\\hat{V}\\) approaches the marginal variance. These facts suggest monitoring convergence by estimating the factor by which the scale of the current distribution for \\(\\psi\\) might be reduced if the simulations were continued. This is the potential scale reduction factor and is estimated by\n\\[\n\\sqrt{\\hat{R}} = \\sqrt{\\frac{\\widehat{Var}(\\psi \\mid Y_0)}{\\hat{V}}},\n\\]\nwhich declines to 1 as \\(T \\rightarrow \\infty\\). When this quantity is high, there is evidence to proceed the simulations further to improve our inference about the target distribution."

Specifically, let \\(\\theta_t\\) be the current estimate of \\(\\theta\\), then the E step finds the expected complete data loglikelihood if \\(\\theta\\) were \\(\\theta_t\\):\n\\[\nQ\\left(\\theta \\mid \\theta_t \\right) = \\int l\\left(\\theta \\mid Y \\right)f\\left(Y_0  \\mid Y_1 , \\theta = \\theta_t \\right)dY_0.\n\\]\nThe M step determines \\(\\theta_{t+1}\\) by maximising this expected complete data loglikelihood:\n\\[\nQ\\left(\\theta_{t+1} \\mid \\theta_t \\right) \\geq Q\\left(\\theta \\mid \\theta_t \\right),\n\\]\nfor all \\(\\theta\\).\n\nUnivariate Normal Data Example\nSuppose \\(y_i\\) form a an iid sample from a Normal distribution with population mean \\(\\mu\\) and variance \\(\\sigma^2\\), for \\(i=1,\\ldots,n_{cc}\\) observed units and \\(i=n_{cc}+1,\\ldots,n\\) missing units. Under the assumption that the missingness mechanism is ignorable, the expectation of each missing \\(y_i\\) given \\(Y_{obs}\\) and \\(\\theta=(\\mu,\\sigma^2)\\) is \\(\\mu\\). Since the loglikelihood based on all \\(y_i\\) is linear in the sufficient statistics \\(\\sum_{i=1}^n y_i\\) and \\(\\sum_{i=1}^n y^2_i\\), the E step of the algorithm calculates\n\\[\nE\\left(\\sum_{i=1}^{n}y_i \\mid \\theta_t, Y_0 \\right) = \\sum_{i=1}^{n_{cc}}y_i + (n-n_{cc})\\mu_t\n\\]\nand\n\\[\nE\\left(\\sum_{i=1}^{n}y^2_i \\mid \\theta_t, Y_0 \\right) = \\sum_{i=1}^{n_{cc}}y^2_i + (n-n_{cc})\\left(\\mu^2_t + \\sigma^2_t \\right)\n\\]\nfor current estimates \\(\\theta_t=(\\mu_t,\\sigma_t)\\) of the parameters. Note that simply substituting \\(\\mu_t\\) for the missing values \\(y_{n_{cc}+1},\\ldots,y_n\\) is not correct since the term \\((n-n_{cc})(\\sigma_t^2)\\) is omitted. Without missing data, the ML estimate of \\(\\mu\\) and \\(\\sigma^2\\) are \\(\\frac{\\sum_{i=1}^ny_i}{n}\\) and \\(\\frac{\\sum_{i=1}^ny^2_i}{n}-\\left(\\frac{\\sum_{i=1}^ny_i}{n}\\right)^2\\), respectively. The M step uses the same expressions based on the current expectations of the sufficient statistics calculated in the E step. Thus, the M step calculates\n\\[\n\\mu_{t+1} = \\frac{E\\left(\\sum_{i=1}^n y_i \\mid \\theta_t, Y_0 \\right)}{n}\n\\]\nand\n\\[\n\\sigma^2_{t+1} = \\frac{E\\left(\\sum_{i=1}^n y^2_i \\mid \\theta_t, Y_0 \\right)}{n} - \\mu^2_{t+1}.\n\\]\nSetting \\(\\mu_t=\\mu_{t+1}=\\hat{\\mu}\\) and \\(\\sigma_t=\\sigma_{t+1}=\\hat{\\sigma}\\) in these equations shows that a fixed point of these iterations is \\(\\hat{\\mu}=\\frac{\\sum_{i=1}^{n_{cc}}y_i}{n_{cc}}\\) and \\(\\hat{\\sigma}^2=\\frac{\\sum_{i=1}^{n_{cc}}y^2_i}{n_{cc}} - \\hat{\\mu}^2\\), which are the ML estimates of the parameters from \\(Y_0\\) assuming MAR and distinctness of the parameters."

    "text": "Extensions of EM\nThere are a variety of applications where the M step does not have a simple computational form. In such cases, one way to avoid an iterative M step is to increase the Q function, rather than maximising it at each iteration, which corresponds to a Generalised Expectation Maximisation(GEM) algorithm. GEM inceases the likelihood at each iteration but appropriate convergence is not guaranteed without further specification of the process of increasing the Q function. One specific case of GEM is the Expectation Conditional Maximisation(ECM) algorithm (Meng and Rubin (1993)), which replaces the M step with a sequence of \\(S\\) conditional maximisation (CM) steps, each of which maximises the Q function over \\(\\theta\\) but with some vector function of \\(\\theta\\), say \\(g_s(\\theta)\\), fixed at its previous values for \\(s=1,\\ldots,S\\). Very briefly, assume that we have a parameter \\(\\theta\\) that can be partitioned into subvectors \\(\\theta=(\\theta_1,\\ldots,\\theta_S)\\), then we can take the \\(s\\)-th of the CM steps to be maximisation with respect to \\(\\theta_s\\) with all other parameters held fixed. Alternatively, it may be useful to take the \\(s\\)-th of the CM steps to be simultaneous maximisation over all of the subvectors expect \\(\\theta_s\\), which is fixed. Because the ECM increases Q, it belongs to the class of GEM algorithms and therefore monotonically increases the likelihood of \\(\\theta\\). When the set of functions \\(g\\) is “space filling” in the sense that it allows unconstrained maximisation over \\(\\theta\\) in its parameter space, ECM converges to a stationary point under the same conditions ensuring convergence of EM.\nThe Expectation Conditional Maximisation Either(ECME) algorithm (Liu and Rubin (1994)) is another version of GEM, which replaces some of the CM steps of ECM, maximising the constrained expected complete data loglikelihood function, with steps that maximise the correspondingly constrained actual likelihood function. The algorithm has stable monotone convergence and basic simplicity implementation relative to competing faster converging methods, and can have faster convergence rate than EM or ECM, measured using either the number of iterations or actual computer time. The The Alternative Expectation Conditional Maximisation(AECM) algorithm (Meng and Van Dyk (1997)) builds on the ECME idea by maximising functions other than Q or L in particular CM steps, corresponding to varying definitions of what constitutes missing data. An iteration of AECM consists of cycles, each consisting of an E step with a particular definition of complete and missing data, followed by CM steps, which can result in enhanced computational efficiency."

    "text": "Bayesian Inference for Complete Data\nBayesian inference is the process of fitting a probability model to a set of data \\(Y\\) and summarising the results by a probability distribution on the parameters \\(\\theta\\) of the model and on unobserved quantities \\(\\tilde{Y}\\) (e.g. predictions). Indeed, Bayesian statistical conclusions about \\(\\theta\\) (or \\(\\tilde{Y}\\)) are made in terms of probability statements, conditional on the observed data \\(Y\\), typically indicated with the notation \\(p(\\theta \\mid y)\\) or \\(p(\\tilde{y} \\mid y)\\). Conditioning on the observed data is what makes Bayesian inference different from standard statistical approaches which are instead based on the retrospective evaluation of the procedures used to estimate \\(\\theta\\) (or \\(\\tilde{y}\\)) over the distribution of possible \\(y\\) values conditional on the “true” unknown value of \\(\\theta\\).\n\nBayes’ Rule\nIn order to make probability statements about \\(\\theta\\) given \\(y\\), we start with a model providing a joint probability distribution \\(p(\\theta,y)\\). Thus, the joint probability mass or density function can be written as a product of two densities that are often referred to as the prior distribution \\(p(\\theta)\\) and the sampling distribution \\(p(y \\mid \\theta)\\), respectively:\n\\[\np(\\theta,y) = p(\\theta)p(y \\mid \\theta),\n\\]\nand conditioning on the observed values of \\(y\\), using the basic property of conditional probability known as Bayes’ rule, yields the posterior distribution\n\\[\np(\\theta \\mid y) = \\frac{p(\\theta,y)}{p(y)} = \\frac{p(\\theta)p(y \\mid \\theta)}{p(y)},\n\\]\nwhere \\(p(y)=\\sum_{\\theta \\in \\Theta}p(\\theta)p(y\\mid \\theta)\\) is the sum (or integral in the case of continous \\(\\theta\\)) over all possible values of \\(\\theta\\) in the sample space \\(\\Theta\\). We can approximate the above equation by omitting the factor \\(p(y)\\) which does not depend on \\(\\theta\\) and, given \\(y\\), can be considered as fixed, yielding the unnormalised posterior density\n\\[\np(\\theta \\mid y) \\propto p(\\theta) p(y \\mid \\theta),\n\\]\nwith the purpose of the analysis being to develop the model \\(p(\\theta,y)\\) and adequately summarise \\(p(\\theta \\mid y)\\).\n\n\nUnivariate Normal Example (known variance)\nLet \\(y=(y_1,\\ldots,y_n)\\) denote an independent and identially distributed sample of \\(n\\) units, which are assumed to come from a Normal distribution with mean \\(\\mu\\) and variance \\(\\sigma^2\\), whose sampling density function is\n\\[\np(y \\mid \\mu)=\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{\\left(2\\pi\\sigma^2\\right)^n}}\\text{exp}\\left(-\\frac{1}{2}\\sum_{i=1}^n \\frac{(y_i-\\mu)^2}{\\sigma^2} \\right),\n\\]\nwhere for the moment we assume the variance \\(\\sigma^2\\) to be known (i.e. constant). Consider now a prior probability distribution for the mean parameter \\(p(\\mu)\\), which belongs to the family of conjugate prior densities, for example a Normal distribution, and parameterised in terms of a prior mean \\(\\mu_0\\) and variance \\(\\sigma^2_0\\). Thus, its prior density function is\n\\[\np(\\mu) = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2\\pi\\sigma^2_0}}\\text{exp}\\left(-\\frac{1}{2}\\frac{(\\mu -\\mu_0)^2}{\\sigma^2} \\right),\n\\]\nunder the assumption tha the hyperparameters \\(\\mu_0\\) and \\(\\sigma^2_0\\) are known. The conjugate prior density implies that the posterior distribution for \\(\\mu\\) (with \\(\\sigma^2\\) assumed constant) belongs to the same family of distributions of the sampling function, that is Normal, but some algebra is required to reveal its specific form. In particular, the posterior density is\n\\[\np(\\mu \\mid y) = \\frac{p(\\mu)p(y\\mid \\mu)}{p(y)} \\propto \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2\\pi\\sigma^2_0}}\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{\\left(2\\pi\\sigma^2\\right)^n}}\\text{exp}\\left(-\\frac{1}{2} \\left[\\frac{(\\mu - \\mu_0)^2}{\\sigma^2_0} + \\sum_{i=1}^n\\frac{(y_i-\\mu)^2}{\\sigma^2} \\right] \\right).\n\\]\nExapanding the components, collecting terms and completing the square in \\(\\mu\\) gives\n\\[\np(\\mu \\mid y) \\propto \\text{exp}\\left(-\\frac{(\\mu - \\mu_1)}{2\\tau^2_1} \\right),\n\\]\nthat is the posterior distribution of \\(\\mu\\) given \\(y\\) is Normal with posterior mean \\(\\mu_1\\) and variance \\(\\tau^2_1\\), where\n\\[\n\\mu_1 = \\frac{\\frac{1}{\\tau^2_0}\\mu_0 + \\frac{n}{\\sigma^2}\\bar{y}}{\\frac{1}{\\tau^2_0} + \\frac{n}{\\sigma^2}} \\;\\;\\; \\text{and} \\;\\;\\; \\frac{1}{\\tau^2_1}=\\frac{1}{\\tau^2_0} + \\frac{n}{\\sigma^2}.\n\\]\nWe can see that the posterior distribution depends on \\(y\\) only through the sample mean \\(\\bar{y}=\\sum_{i=1}^ny_i\\), which is a sufficient statistic in this model. When working with Normal distributions, the inverse of the variance plays a prominent role and is called the precision and, from the above expressions, it can be seen that for normal data and prior, the posterior precision \\(\\frac{1}{\\tau^2_1}\\) equals the sum of the prior precision \\(\\frac{1}{\\tau^2_0}\\) and the sampling precision \\(\\frac{n}{\\sigma^2}\\). Thus, when \\(n\\) is large, the posterior precision is largely dominated by \\(\\sigma^2\\) and the sample mean \\(\\bar{y}\\) compared to the corresponding prior parameters. In the specific case where \\(\\tau^2_0=\\sigma^2\\), the prior has the same weight as one extra observation with the value of \\(\\mu_0\\) and, as \\(n\\rightarrow\\infty\\), we have that \\(p(\\mu\\mid y)\\approx N\\left(\\mu \\mid \\bar{y},\\frac{\\sigma^2}{n}\\right)\\).\n\n\nUnivariate Normal Example (unknown variance)\nFor \\(p(y \\mid \\mu,\\sigma^2)=N(y \\mid \\mu, \\sigma^2)\\) with \\(\\mu\\) known and \\(\\sigma^2\\) unknown, the sampling distribution for a vector \\(y\\) of \\(n\\) units is\n\\[\np(y \\mid \\sigma^2)=\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{\\left(2\\pi\\sigma^2\\right)^n}}\\text{exp}\\left(-\\frac{1}{2}\\sum_{i=1}^n \\frac{(y_i-\\mu)^2}{\\sigma^2} \\right),\n\\]\nwith the corresponding conjugate prior for \\(\\sigma^2\\) being the Inverse-Gamma distribution \\(\\Gamma^{-1}(\\alpha,\\beta)\\) with density function\n\\[\np(\\sigma^2) \\propto (\\sigma^2)^{-(\\alpha+1)}\\text{exp}\\left(-\\frac{\\beta}{\\sigma^2}\\right),\n\\]\nindexed by the hyperparameters \\(\\alpha\\) and \\(\\beta\\). A convenient parameterisation is as a Scaled Inverse-Chi Squared distribution \\(\\text{Inv-}\\chi^2(\\sigma^2_0,\\nu_0)\\) with scale and degrees of freedom parameters \\(\\sigma^2_0\\) and \\(\\nu_0\\), respectively. This means that the prior on \\(\\sigma^2\\) corresponds to the distribution of \\(\\frac{\\sigma^2_0 \\nu_0}{X}\\), where \\(X\\sim \\chi^2_{\\nu_0}\\) random variable. After some calculations, the resulting posterior for \\(\\sigma^2\\) is\n\\[\np(\\sigma^2 \\mid y) \\propto (\\sigma^2)^\\left(\\frac{n+\\nu_0}{2}+1\\right)\\text{exp}\\left(-\\frac{\\nu_0 \\sigma^2_0 + n \\nu}{2\\sigma^2} \\right)\n\\]\nwhere \\(\\nu=\\frac{1}{n}\\sum_{i=1}^n(y_i-\\mu)^2\\). This corresponds to say that\n\\[\n\\sigma^2 \\mid y \\sim \\text{Inv-}\\chi^2\\left(\\nu_0 +n, \\frac{\\nu_0\\sigma^2_0+n\\nu}{\\nu_0 + n} \\right),\n\\]\nwith scale equal to the degrees of freedom-weighted average of the prior and data scales and degrees of freedom equal to the sum of the prior and data degrees of freedom.\n\n\nUnivariate Normal Example (unknown mean and variance)\nSuppose now that both the mean and variance parameters are unknown such that\n\\[\np(y \\mid \\mu, \\sigma^2) \\sim N(\\mu, \\sigma^2),\n\\]\nand that the interest is centred on making inference about \\(\\mu\\), that is we seek the conditional posterior distribution of the parameters of interest given the observed data \\(p(\\mu \\mid y)\\). This can be derived from the joint posterior distribution density \\(p(\\mu, \\sigma^2 \\mid y)\\) by averaging over all possible values of \\(\\sigma^2\\), that is\n\\[\np(\\mu \\mid y)=\\int p(\\mu, \\sigma^2 \\mid y)d\\sigma^2,\n\\]\nor, alternatively, the joint posterior can be factored as the product of the marginal distribution of one parameter and the conditional distribution of the other given the former and then taking the average over the values of the “nuisance” parameter\n\\[\np(\\mu \\mid y)=\\int p(\\mu \\mid \\sigma^2, y)p(\\sigma^2 \\mid y)d\\sigma^2.\n\\]\nThe integral forms are rarely computed in practice but this expression helps us to understand that posterior distributions can be expressed in terms of the product of marginal and conditional densities, first drawing \\(\\sigma^2\\) from its marginal and then \\(\\mu\\) from its conditional given the drawn value of \\(\\sigma^2\\), so that the integration is indirectly performed. For example, consider the Normal model with both unknown mean and variance and assume a vague prior density \\(p(\\mu,\\sigma^2)\\propto (\\sigma^2)^{-1}\\) (corresponding to uniform prior on \\((\\mu, \\log\\sigma)\\)), then the joint posterior distribution is proportional to the sampling distribution multiplied by the factor \\((\\sigma^2)^{-1}\\), that is\n\\[\np(\\mu,\\sigma^2 \\mid y)\\propto \\sigma^{-n-2}\\text{exp}\\left(-\\frac{1}{2\\sigma^2}\\left[(n-1)s^2+n(\\bar{y}-\\mu)^2 \\right] \\right),\n\\]\nwhere \\(s^2=\\frac{1}{n-1}\\sum_{i=1}^n(y_i-\\bar{y})^2\\) is the sample variance. Next, the conditional posterior density \\(p(\\mu \\mid \\sigma^2)\\) can be shown to be equal to\n\\[\np(\\mu \\mid \\sigma^2,y) \\sim N(\\bar{y},\\frac{\\sigma^2}{n}),\n\\]\nwhile the marginal posterior \\(p(\\sigma^2 \\mid y)\\) can be obtained by averaging the joint \\(p(\\mu,\\sigma^2\\mid y)\\) over \\(\\mu\\), that is\n\\[\np(\\sigma^2 \\mid y)\\propto \\int \\left(\\sigma^{-n-2}\\text{exp}\\left(-\\frac{1}{2\\sigma^2}\\left[(n-1)s^2+n(\\bar{y}-\\mu)^2 \\right] \\right)\\right)d\\mu,\n\\]\nwhich leads to\n\\[\np(\\sigma^2 \\mid ,y) \\sim \\text{Inv-}\\chi^2(n-1,s^2).\n\\]\nTypically, \\(\\mu\\) represents the estimand of interest and the obejective of the analysis is therefore to make inference about the marginal distribution \\(p(\\mu \\mid y)\\), which can be obtained by integrating \\(\\sigma^2\\) out of the joint posterior\n\\[\np(\\mu \\mid y)=\\int_{0}^{\\infty}p(\\mu,\\sigma^2\\mid y)d\\sigma^2 \\propto \\left[1+\\frac{n(\\mu-\\bar{y})}{(n-1)s^2} \\right]\n\\]\nwhich corresponds to a Student-\\(t\\) density with \\(n-1\\) degrees of freedom\n\\[\np(\\mu \\mid y)\\sim t_{n-1}\\left(\\bar{y},\\frac{s^2}{n}\\right)\n\\]\n\n\nMultivariate Normal Example\nSimilar considerations to those applied to the univariate case can be extended to the multivariate case when \\(y\\) is formed by \\(J\\) components coming from the Multivariate Normal distribution\n\\[\np(y\\mid \\mu, \\Sigma) \\sim N(\\mu, \\Sigma),\n\\]\nwhere \\(\\mu\\) is a vector of length \\(J\\) and \\(\\Sigma\\) is a \\(J\\times J\\) covariance matrix, which is symmetric and positive definite. The sampling distribution for a sample of \\(n\\) units is\n\\[\np(y\\mid \\mu, \\Sigma) \\propto \\mid \\Sigma \\mid^{-n/2}\\text{exp}\\left(-\\frac{1}{2}\\sum_{i=1}^n(y_i-\\mu)^{T}\\Sigma^{-1}(y_i-\\mu) \\right),\n\\]\nAs with the univariate normal model, we can derive the posterior distribution for \\(\\mu\\) and \\(\\Sigma\\) according to the factorisation used of the joint posterior and the prior distributions specified. For example, using the conjugate normal prior for the mean \\(p(\\mu)\\sim N(\\mu_0,\\Sigma_0)\\), given \\(\\Sigma\\) known, the posterior can be shown to be\n\\[\np(\\mu \\mid y) \\sim N(\\mu_1,\\Sigma_1),\n\\]\nwhere the posterior mean is a weighted average of the data and prior mean with weights given by the data and prior precision matrices \\(\\mu_1=(\\Sigma^{-1}_0+n\\Sigma^{-1})^{-1} (\\Sigma_0^{-1}\\mu_0 + n\\Sigma^{-1}\\bar{y})\\), and the posterior precision is the sum of the data and prior precisions \\(\\Sigma^{-1}_1=\\Sigma^{-1}_0+n\\Sigma^{-1}\\).\nIn the situation in which both \\(\\mu\\) and \\(\\Sigma\\) are unknown, convenient conjugate prior distributions which generalise those used in the univariate case are the Inverse-Wishart for the covariance matrix \\(\\Sigma\\sim \\text{Inv-Wishart}(\\Lambda_0,\\nu_0)\\) and the Multivariate Normal for the mean \\(\\mu\\sim N(\\mu_0, \\Sigma_0)\\), where \\(\\nu_0\\) and \\(\\Lambda_0\\) represent the degrees of freedom and the scale matrix for the Inverse-Wishart distribution, while \\(\\mu_0\\) and \\(\\Sigma_0=\\frac{\\Sigma}{\\kappa_0}\\) are the prior mean and covariance matrix for the Multivariate Normal. Woking out the form of the posterior, it can be shown that the joint posterior distribution has the same form of the sampling distribution with parameters\n\\[\np(\\mu \\mid \\Sigma, y) \\sim N(\\mu_1,\\Sigma_1) \\;\\;\\; \\text{and} \\;\\;\\; p(\\Sigma \\mid y) \\sim \\text{Inv-Wishart}(\\Lambda_1,\\nu_1),\n\\]\nwhere \\(\\Sigma_1=\\frac{\\Sigma}{\\kappa_1}\\), \\(\\mu_1=\\frac{1}{\\kappa_0+n}\\mu_0+\\frac{n}{\\kappa_0+n}\\bar{y}\\), \\(\\kappa_1=\\kappa_0+n\\), \\(\\nu_1=\\nu_0+n\\), and \\(\\Lambda_1=\\Lambda_0+\\sum_{i=1}^n(y_i-\\bar{y})(y_i-\\bar{y})^T+\\frac{\\kappa_0 n}{\\kappa_0+n}(\\bar{y}-\\mu_0)(\\bar{y}-\\mu_0)^2\\)."

Robins, Rotnitzky, and Zhao (1994) introduced Inverse Probability Weighting (IPW) as a weighted regression approach that require an explicit model for the missingness but relaxes some of the parametric assumptions in the data model. Their method is an extension of Generalized Estimating Equations (GEE), a popular technique for modeling marginal or populationaveraged relationships between a response variable and predictors (Zeger, Liang, and Albert (1988)).\nLet \\(y_i=(y_{i1},\\ldots,y_{iK})\\) denote a vector of variables for unit \\(i\\) subject to missing values with \\(y_i\\) being fully observed for \\(i=1\\ldots,n_r\\) units and partially-observed for \\(i=n_r+1,\\ldots,n\\) units. Define \\(m_i=1\\) if \\(y_i\\) is incomplete and \\(m_i=0\\) if complete. Let \\(x_i=(x_{i1},\\ldots,x_{ip})\\) denote a vector of fully observed covariates and suppose the interest is in estimating the mean of the distribution of \\(y_i\\) given \\(x_i\\), having the form \\(g(x_i,\\beta)\\), where \\(g()\\) is a possibly non-linear regression function indexed by a parameter \\(\\beta\\) of dimension \\(d\\). Let also \\(z_i=(z_{i1},\\ldots,z_{iq})\\) be a vector of fully observed auxiliary variables that potentially predictive of missingness but are not included in the model for \\(y_i \\mid x_i\\). When there are no missing data, a consistent estimate of \\(\\beta\\) is given by the solution to the following GEE, under mild regularity conditions (Liang and Zeger (1986)),\n\\[\n\\sum_{i=1}^n = D_i(x_i,\\beta)(y_i-g(x_i,\\beta))=0,\n\\]\nwhere \\(D_i(x_i,\\beta)\\) is a suitably chosen \\((d\\times k)\\) matrix of known functions of \\(x_i\\). With missing data, the equation is applied only to the complete cases (\\(n_{r}\\)), which yields consistent estimates provided that\n\\[\np(m_i=1 \\mid x_i,y_i,z_i,\\phi)=p(m_i=1\\mid x_i,\\phi),\n\\]\nthat is, missingness does not depend on \\(y_i\\) or \\(z_i\\) after conditioning on \\(x_i\\). IPW GEE methods (Robins and Rotnitzky (1995)) replace the equation with\n\\[\n\\sum_{i=1}^{n_r} = w_i(\\hat{\\alpha})D_i(x_i,\\beta)(y_i-g(x_i,\\beta))=0,\n\\]\nwhere \\(w_i(\\hat{\\alpha})=\\frac{1}{p(x_i,z_i \\mid \\hat{\\alpha})}\\), with \\(p(x_i,z_i \\mid \\hat{\\alpha})\\) being an estimate of the probability of being a complete unit, obtained for example via logistic regressions on \\(m_i\\) on \\(x_i\\) and \\(z_i\\). If the logistic regression is correctly specified, IPW GEE yields a consistent estimator of \\(\\beta\\) provided that\n\\[\np(m_i=1 \\mid x_i,y_i,z_i,\\phi)=p(m_i=1\\mid x_i,z_i\\phi).\n\\]"

The basic intuition of IPW methods is that each subject’s contribution to the weighted Complete Case Analysis (CCA) is replicated \\(w_i\\) times in order to account once for herself and \\((1-w_i)\\) times for those subjects with the same responses and covariates who are missing. These models are called semiparametric because they apart from requiring the regression equation to have a specific form, they do not specify any probability distribution for the response variable (Molenberghs et al. (2014)). Older GEE methods can accommodate missing values only if they are Missing Completely At Random (MCAR), while more recent methods allow them to be MAR or even Missing Not At Random (MNAR), provided that a model for the missingness is correctly specified (Robins, Rotnitzky, and Zhao (1995),Rotnitzky, Robins, and Scharfstein (1998))."

    "section": "",
    "text": "Multiple Imputation(MI) refers to the procedure of replacing each missing value by a set of \\(H\\geq 2\\) imputed values. These are ordered in the sense that \\(H\\) completed data sets can be created from the sets of imputations, where the first imputed value replaces the missing value in the first completed data set, the second imputed value in the second completed data set, and so on. Next, standard complete data methods are used to analyse each completed data set. When the \\(H\\) sets of imputations are repeated random draws from the predictive distribution of the missing data under a particular model of missingness, the \\(H\\) completed data inferences can be combined to form one inference that properly reflects uncertainty due to missing values under that model. In general, MI procedures can be summarised in three main steps:\nMi was first proposed by Rubin (Rubin (1978)) and has become more popular over time (Rubin (1996), Schafer and Graham (2002), Little and Rubin (2019)), as well as the focus of research for methodological and practical applications in a variety of fields (Herzog and Rubin (1983), Rubin and Schenker (1987), Schafer (1999), Carpenter and Kenward (2012), Molenberghs et al. (2014), Van Buuren (2018)). MI shares both advantages of Single Imputaiton (SI) methods and solves both disadvantages. Indeed, like SI, MI methods allow the analyst to use familiar complete data methods when analysing the completed data sets. The only disadvantage of MI compared with SI methods is that it takes more time to generate the imputations and analyse the completed data sets. However, Rubin (2004) showed that in order to obtain sufficiently precise estimates, a relatively small number of imputations (typically \\(10\\)) is required. For example, considering a situation with \\(\\lambda=50\\%\\) missing information and \\(H=10\\) imputations, the efficiency of MI can be shown to be equal to \\((1+\\frac{\\lambda}{H})^{-1}=95\\%\\). In addition, in today’s computing environments, the work of analysing the completed data sets is quite modest since it involves performing the same task \\(H\\) times. Thus, once a precedure to combine multiple completed data sets is established, the additonal time and effort to handle \\(50\\), \\(20\\), or \\(10\\) imputations if often of little consequence.\nIn the first step of MI, imputations should ideally be created as repeated draws from the posterior predictive distribution of the missing values \\(y_{mis}\\) given the observed values \\(y_{obs}\\), each repetition being an independent drawing of the parameters and missing values. In practice, implicit imputation models can also be used in place of explicit imputation models (Herzog and Rubin (1983)). In the second step, each completed data set is analysed using the same complete data method that would be used in the absence of missingness. Finally, in the last step, standard procedures should be used to combine the compelted data inferences into a single one. The simplest and most popular method for combining the reuslts of \\(H\\) completed data sets is known as Rubin’s rules (Rubin (2004)), which can be explained with a simple example."

Then, according to Rubin’s rules, the combined estimate is simply the average of the \\(H\\) completed data estimates, that is\n\\[\n\\bar{\\theta}_{H}=\\frac{1}{H}\\sum_{h=1}^{H}\\hat{\\theta}_{h}.\n\\]\nBecause the imputations under MI are conditional draws, under a good imputation model, they provide valid estimates for a wide range of estimands. In addition, the averaging over \\(H\\) imputed data sets increases the efficiency of estimation over that obtained from a single completed data set. The variability associated with the pooled estimate has two components: the average within-imputation variance \\(\\bar{V}_H\\) and the between-imputation variance \\(B_H\\), defined as\n\\[\n\\bar{V}_{H}=\\frac{1}{H}\\sum_{h=1}^{H}V_{h} \\;\\;\\; \\text{and} \\;\\;\\; B_{H}=\\frac{1}{H-1}\\sum_{h=1}^{H}(\\hat{\\theta}_{h}-\\bar{\\theta}_{H})^2.\n\\]\nThe total variability associated with \\(\\bar{\\theta}_H\\) is the computed as\n\\[\nT_{H}=\\bar{V}_H + \\frac{H+1}{H}B_{H},\n\\]\nwhere \\((1+\\frac{1}{H})\\) is an adjustment factor for finite due to estimating \\(\\theta\\) by \\(\\bar{\\theta}_H\\). Thus, \\(\\hat{\\lambda}_H=(1+\\frac{1}{H})\\frac{B_H}{T_H}\\) is known as the fraction of missing information and is an estimate of the fraction of information about \\(\\theta\\) that is missing due to nonresponse. For large sample sizes and scalar quantities like \\(\\theta\\), the reference distribution for interval estimates and significance tests is a \\(t\\) distribution\n\\[\n(\\theta - \\bar{\\theta}_H)\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{T^2_H}} \\sim t_v,\n\\]\nwhere the degrees of freedom \\(v\\) can be approximated with the quantity \\(v=(H-1)\\left(1+\\frac{1}{H+1}\\frac{\\bar{V}_H}{B_H} \\right)^2\\) (Rubin and Schenker (1987)). In small data sets, an improved version of \\(v\\) can be obtained as \\(v^\\star=(\\frac{1}{v}+\\frac{1}{\\hat{v}_{obs}})^{-1}\\), where\n\\[\n\\hat{v}_{obs}=(1-\\hat{\\lambda}_{H})\\left(\\frac{v_{com}+1}{v_{com}+3}\\right)v_{com},\n\\]\nwith \\(v_{com}\\) being the degrees of freedom for appropriate or exact \\(t\\) inferences about \\(\\theta\\) when there are no missing values (Barnard and Rubin (1999)).\nThe validity of MI rests on how the imputations are created and how that procedure relates to the model used to subsequently analyze the data. Creating MIs often requires special algorithms (Schafer (1997)). In general, they should be drawn from a distribution for the missing data that reflects uncertainty about the parameters of the data model. Recall that with SI methods, it is desirable to impute from the conditional distribution \\(p(y_{mis}\\mid y_{obs},\\hat{\\theta})\\), where \\(\\hat{\\theta}\\) is an estimate derived from the observed data. MI extends this approach by first simulating \\(H\\) independent plausible values for the parameters \\(\\theta_1,\\ldots,\\theta_H\\) and then drawing the missing values \\(y_{mis}^h\\) from \\(p(y_{mis}\\mid y_{obs}, \\theta_h)\\). Treating parameters as random rather than fixed is an essential part of MI. For this reason, it is natural (but not essential) to motivate MI from the Bayesian perspective, in which the state of knowledge about parameters is represented through a posterior distribution."

    "text": "Joint Multiple Imputation\nJoint MI starts from the assumption that the data can be described by a multivariate distribution which in many cases, mostly for practical reasons, corresponds to assuming a multivariate Normal distribution. The general idea is that, for a general missing data pattern $ r$, missingness may occur anywhere in the multivariate outcome vector $ y=(y_1,,y_J)$, so that the distribution from which imputations should be drawn varies based on the observed variables in each pattern. For example, given $ r=(0,0,1,1)$, then imputations should be drawn from the bivariate distribution of the missing variables given the observed variables in that pattern, that is from \\(f(y^{mis}_1,y^{mis}_2 \\mid y^{obs}_3, y^{obs}_4, \\phi_{12})\\), where \\(\\phi_{12}\\) is the probability of being in pattern $ r$ where the first two variables are missing.\nConsider the multivariate Normal distribution \\(y \\sim N(\\mu,\\Sigma)\\), where \\(\\theta=(\\mu,\\Sigma)\\) represent the vector of the parameters of interest which need to be identified. Indeed, for non-monotone missing data, $ $ cannot be generally identified based on the observed data directly $ y^{obs}$, and the typical solution is to iterate imputation and parameter estimation using a general algorithm known as data augmentation(Tanner and Wong (1987)). Following Van Buuren (2018), the general procedure of the algorithm can be summarised as follows:\n\nDefine some plausible starting values for all parameters \\(\\theta_0=(\\mu_0,\\Sigma_0)\\)\nAt each iteration \\(t=1,\\ldots,T\\), draw \\(h=1,\\ldots,H\\) imputations for each missing value from the predictive distribution of the missing data given the observed data and the current value of the parameters at \\(t-1\\), that is\n\n\\[\n\\hat{y}^{mis}_{t} \\sim p(y^{mis} \\mid y^{obs},\\theta_{t-1})\n\\]\n\nRe-estimate the parameters \\(\\theta\\) using the observed and imputed data at \\(t\\) based on the multivariate Normal model, that is\n\n\\[\n\\hat{\\theta}_{t} \\sim p(\\theta \\mid y^{obs}, \\hat{y}^{mis}_{t})\n\\]\nAnd reiterate the steps 2 and 3 until convergence, where the stopping rule typically consists in imposing that the change in the parameters between iterations \\(t-1\\) and \\(t\\) should be smaller than a predefined “small” threshold \\(\\epsilon\\). Schafer (1997) showed that imputations generated under the multivariate Normal model can be robust to non-normal data, even though it is generally more efficient to transform the data towards normality, especially when the parameters of interest are difficult to estimate, such as quantiles and variances.\nThe multivariate Normal model is also often applied to categorical data, with different types of specifications that have been proposed in the literature (Schafer (1997),Horton, Lipsitz, and Parzen (2003),Allison (2005),Bernaards, Belin, and Schafer (2007),Yucel, He, and Zaslavsky (2008),Demirtas (2009)). For examples, missing data in contingency tables can be imputed using log-linear models (Schafer (1997)); mixed continuous-categorical data can be imputed under the general location model which combines a log-linear and multivariate Normal model (Olkin, Tate, et al. (1961)); two-way imputation can be applied to missing test item responses by imputing missing categorical data by conditioning on the row and column sum scores of the multivariate data (Van Ginkel et al. (2007))."

The distinction between the two factorisations becomes clearer when considering a specific example.\nSuppose thta missing values are confined to a single variable and let \\(y_i=(y_{i,1},y_{i2})\\) be a bivariate response outcome where \\(y_{i1}\\) is fully observed and \\(y_{i2}\\) is observed for \\(i=1,\\ldots,n_{cc}\\) but missing for \\(i=n_{cc}+1,\\ldots,n\\).

Under MAR, this is identified using the distribution of the observed data \\(f(y_{i2} \\mid x_i, m_{i2}=1,\\xi)=f(y_{i2} \\mid x_i, m_{i2}=0,\\xi)\\), while under MNAR it must be identified using other assumptions. The SM formulation is\n\\[\nf(y_i, m_{i2} \\mid \\theta, \\psi) = f(y_{i1} \\mid x_i, \\theta)f(y_{i2} \\mid x_i, y_{i1},\\theta)f(m_{i2}\\mid x_i,y_{i1},y_{i2},\\psi).\n\\]\nTypically, the missingness mechanism \\(f(m_{i2} \\mid x_i,y_{i1},y_{i2},\\psi)\\) is modelled using some additive probit or logit regression of \\(m_{i2}\\) on \\(x_i\\),\\(y_{i1}\\) and \\(y_{i2}\\). However, the coefficient of \\(y_{i2}\\) in this regression is not directly estimable from the data and hence the model cannot be fully estimated without extra assumptions.\n\nNormal Models for MNAR data\nAssume we have a complete sample \\((y_i,x_i)\\) on a continuous variable \\(Y\\) and a set of fully observed covariates \\(X\\), for \\(i=1,\\ldots,n\\). Suppose that \\(i=1,\\ldots,n_{cc}\\) units are observed while the remaining \\(i=n_{cc}+1,\\ldots,n\\) units are missing, with \\(m_i\\) being the corresponding missingness indicator. Heckman (Heckman (1976)) proposed the following selection model to handle missingness:\n\\[\ny_i \\mid x_i, \\theta, \\psi \\sim N(\\beta_0 + \\beta_1x_i, \\sigma^2) \\;\\;\\; \\text{and} \\;\\;\\; m_i \\mid x_i,y_i,\\theta,\\psi \\sim Bern\\left(\\Phi(\\psi_0 + \\psi_1x_i + \\psi_2y_i) \\right),\n\\]\nwhere \\(\\theta=(\\beta_0,\\beta_1,\\sigma^2)\\) and \\(\\Phi\\) denotes the probit (cumulative normal) distribution function. Note that if \\(\\psi_2=0\\), the missing data are MAR, while if \\(\\psi_2 \\neq 0\\) the missing data are MNAR since missingness in \\(Y\\) depends on the unobserved value of \\(Y\\). This model can be estimated using either a two-step least squares method, ML in combination with an EM algorithm, or a Bayesian approach. The main issue is the lack of information about \\(\\psi_2\\), which can be partly identified through the specific assumptions about the distribution of the observed data of \\(Y\\). This, however, makes the implicit assumption that the assumed distribution can well described the distribution of the complete (observed and missing) data which can never be tested or checked. An alternative approach is to use a PMM factorisation and model:\n\\[\ny_i \\mid m_i=m,x_i,\\xi,\\omega \\sim N(\\beta_0^m + \\beta_1^mx_i, \\sigma^{2m})\\;\\;\\; \\text{and} \\;\\;\\; m_i \\mid x_i,\\xi,\\omega \\sim Bern\\left(\\Phi(\\omega_0 + \\omega_1x_i) \\right),\n\\]\nwhere \\(\\xi=(\\beta_0^m,\\beta_1^m,\\sigma^{2m},\\;\\;\\; m=0,1)\\). This model implies that the distribution of \\(y_i\\) given \\(x_i\\) in the population is a mixture of two normal distributions with mean\n\\[\n\\left[1 - \\Phi(\\omega_0 + \\omega_1x_i) \\right] \\left[\\beta_0^0 + \\beta_1^0 x_i \\right] + \\left[\\Phi(\\omega_0 + \\omega_1x_i) \\right] \\left[\\beta_0^1 + \\beta_1^1 x_i \\right].\n\\]\nThe parameters \\((\\beta_0^0,\\beta_1^0,\\sigma^{20},\\omega)\\) can be estimated from the data but the parameters \\((\\beta_0^1,\\beta_1^1,\\sigma^{21})\\) are not estimable because \\(y_i\\) is missing when \\(m_i=1\\). Under MAR, the distribution of \\(Y\\) given \\(X\\) is the same for units with \\(Y\\) observed and missing, such that \\(\\beta_0^0=\\beta_0^1=\\beta_0\\) (as well as for \\(\\beta_1\\) and \\(\\sigma^2\\)). Under MNAR, other assumptions are needed to esitmate the parameters indexed by \\(m=1\\).\nSome final considerations:\n\nBoth SM and PMM model the joint distribution of \\(Y\\) and \\(M\\).\nThe SM formulation is more natural when the substantive interest concerns the relationship between \\(Y\\) and \\(X\\) in the population. However, these parameters can also be derived in PMM by averaging the patterns specific parameters over the missingness patterns.\nThe PMM factorisation is more transparent in terms of the underlying assumptions about the unidentified parameters of the model, while SM tends to impose some obscure constraints in order to identify these parameters, which are also difficult to interpret.\nGiven specific assumptions to identify all the parameters in the model, PMMs are often easier to fit than SMs. In addition, imputations of the missing values are based on the predictive distribution of \\(Y\\) given \\(X\\) and \\(M=0\\).\n\nThese considerations seem to favour PMM over SM as MNAR approaches, especially when considering sensitivity analysis. Bayesian approaches can also be used to identify these models, by assigning prior distributions which can be used to identify those parameters which cannot be estimated from the data. Justifications for the choice of these priors are therefore necessary to ensure the plausibility of the assumptions assessed and the impact of these assumptions on the posterior inference."

Thus, under the PMM approach, the response model \\(f(y \\mid \\theta)\\) can be retrieved as a mixture of the pattern specific distributions\n\\[\nf(y \\mid \\theta) = \\sum_{r}f(y \\mid r, \\phi)f(r \\mid \\chi),\n\\]\nwith weights given by the corresponding probabilities of the different patterns. The missingness mechanism \\(f(r \\mid y, \\psi)\\) can also be obtained using Bayes’ rule\n\\[\nf(y \\mid r, \\psi) = \\frac{f(y \\mid r, \\phi)f(r\\mid \\chi)}{f(y \\mid \\theta)}.\n\\]\nThe construction of PMMs requires the specification of the full data distribution conditional on different missingness patterns, which may be cumbersome when the number of patterns is large, but with the advantage of making explicit the parameters that cannot be identified by the observed data. In particular, PMMs are well suited to show that the distribution of the response within each pattern can be decomposed as\n\\[\nf(y_{obs},y_{mis} \\mid r, \\phi)= f(y_{mis} \\mid y_{obs},r,\\phi_{E})f(y_{obs}\\mid r,\\phi_{O}),\n\\]\nwhere \\(\\phi_E = \\lambda_1(\\phi)\\) and \\(\\phi_O=\\lambda_2(\\phi)\\) are functions of the mixture component parameter \\(\\phi\\). The former subset of parameters indexes the so called extrapolation distribution and cannot be identified from the data, i.e. the distribution of the missing values given the observed values, while the latter indexes the observed data distribution and is typically identifiable from the data. Assuming there exists a partition such that \\(\\phi_E=(\\phi_{EI},\\phi_{ENI})\\) and the observed data distribution is a function of \\(\\phi_{EI}\\) but not of \\(\\phi_{ENI}\\), then \\(\\phi_{ENI}\\) is a senstivity parameter in that it can only be identified using information from sources other than the observed data and thus makes a suitable basis to formulate sensitivity analysis using informative priors.\n\nExample of PMM for bivariate normal data\nConsider a sample of \\(i=1,\\ldots,n\\) units from a bivariate normal distribution \\(Y=(Y_1,Y_2)\\). Assume also that \\(Y_1\\) is always observed while \\(Y_2\\) may be missing, and let \\(R=R_2\\) be the missingness indicator for the partially-observed response \\(Y_2\\). A PMM factors the full data distribution as\n\\[\nf(y_1,y_2,r \\mid \\omega) = f(y_1, y_2 \\mid r, \\phi)f(r \\mid ,\\chi),\n\\]\nwhere, for example, we may have \\(Y \\mid R=1 \\sim N(\\mu^1,\\Sigma^1)\\), \\(Y \\mid R=0 \\sim N(\\mu^0,\\Sigma^0)\\) and \\(R \\sim Bern(\\chi)\\). We define \\(\\mu^r=(\\mu^r_1)\\), while \\(\\Sigma^r\\) has elements \\(\\sigma^r=(\\sigma^r_{11},\\sigma^r_{12},\\sigma^r_{22})\\). Similarly, we can define the parameters \\(\\beta^r_0\\), \\(\\beta^r_1\\) and \\(\\sigma^r_{2\\mid 1}\\) as the intercept, slope and residual variance of the regression of \\(Y_2\\) on \\(Y_1\\) for each pattern \\(r\\). Under this reparameterisation, the full data model parameters are\n\\[\n\\phi=\\{\\mu^r_1,\\sigma^r_{11},\\beta^r_0,\\beta^1_1,\\sigma^r_{2\\mid 1}\\}.\n\\]\nThe extrapolation and observed data distributions, with associated parameters, are then\n\\[\nf(y_{mis}\\mid y_{obs},\\phi_{E}) \\rightarrow \\phi_{E}=(\\beta^0_0, \\beta^0_1,\\sigma^0_{2\\mid1})\n\\]\nand\n\\[\nf(y_{obs}\\mid \\phi_{O}) \\rightarrow \\phi_{O}=(\\mu^1,\\beta^1,\\sigma^1_{11},\\mu^0_0,\\sigma^1_{11}).\n\\]\nIt can be shown that, in this specific example, the observed data distribution does not depend on the parameters indexing the extrapolation distribtuon \\(\\phi_{ENI}=(\\beta^0_0,\\beta^0_1,\\sigma^0_{2\\mid 1})\\). It is possible to set \\(\\beta^0=\\beta=1\\) and \\(\\sigma^0_{2\\mid1}=\\sigma^1_{2\\mid1}\\) to yield a Missing At Random(MAR) assumption. Hence, a function that maps identified parameters and sensitivity parameters \\(\\Delta\\) to the space of unidentified parameters can be used to quantify departures from MAR. For example, assume we impose\n\\[\n\\beta^0_0=\\beta^1_0+\\Delta,\n\\]\nthen assigning a point mass prior at \\(\\Delta=0\\) implies MAR, while fixing \\(\\Delta \\neq 0\\) or using any type of inofrmative prior on this parameter implies a Missing Not At Random(MNAR) assumption."

The general form of the full data modelling using a SPM approach is\n\\[\nf(y,r \\mid \\omega) = \\int f(y, r, b \\mid \\omega)db.\n\\]\nNext, specific SPMs are formulated by making assumptions about the joint distribution under the integral sign. Main advantages of this models is that they are quite easy to specify and that, through the use of random effects, high-dimensional or multilevel data modelling is relatively easy to accomplish. The main drawback is that the underlying missingness mechanism is often difficult to understand and may not have even a closed form.\n\nExample random coefficients selection model\nWu and Carroll (1988) specified a SPM assuming the response follow a linear random effects model\n\\[\nY_i \\mid x_i,b_i \\sim N(x_i\\beta + w_ib_i, \\Sigma_i(\\phi)),\n\\]\nwhere \\(w_i\\) are the random effects covariates with rows \\(w_i=(1,t_{ij})\\), therefore implying that each individual has a random slope and intercept.

    "title": "The P value fallacy",
    "section": "",
    "text": "Today, I would like to briefly comment an interesting research article written by Goodman, who provided a clear and exemplary discussion about the typical incorrect interpretation of a standard frequentist analysis in the field of medical research. I will now briefly summarise the main argument of the paper and then add some personal comments.\nEssentially, the article describes the characteristics of the dominant school of medical statistics and highlights the logical fallacy at the heart of the typical frequentist analysis in clinical studies. This is based on a deductive inferential approach, which starts with a given hypothesis and makes conclusions under the assumption that the hypothesis is true. This is in contrast with a inductive approach, which uses the observed evidence to evaluate what hypothesis is most tenable. The two most popular methods of the frequentist paradigm are the P value proposed by Fisher and the hypothesis testing developed by Neyman and Pearson.\nThe P value is defined as the probability, under the assumption of no effect (null hypothesis), of obtaining a result equal to or more extreme than what was actually observed. Fisher proposed it as an informal index to be used as a measure of discrepancy between the data and the null hypothesis and therefore should not be interpreted as a formal inferential method. For example, since the P value can only be calculated on the assumption that the null hypothesis is true, it cannot be a direct measure of the probability that the null hypothesis is false. However, the main criticism to the P value is perhaps that it does not take into account the size of the observed effect, i.e. a small effect in a study with a large sample size can have the same P value as a large effect in a small study.\nHypothesis testing was proposed by Neyman and Pearson as an alternative approach to the P value, which assumes the existence of a null hypothesis (e.g. no effect) and an alternative hypothesis (e.g. nonzero effect). The outcome of the test is then simply to reject one hypothesis in favour of the other, solely based on the data. This exposes the researcher to two types of errors: type I error or false-positive (\\(\\alpha\\)) and type II error or false-negative (\\(\\beta\\)) result. Rather than focussing on single experiments, like the P value, hypothesis testing is effectively based on a deductive approach to minimise the errors over a large number of experiments. However, the price to pay to obtain this objectivity is the impossibility to make any inferential statement about a single experiment. The procedure only guarantees that in the long run, i.e. after considering many experiments, we shall not often be wrong.\nOver time a combination between the P value and hypothesis testing was developed under the assumption that the two approaches can be complementary. The idea was that the P value could be used to measure evidence in a single experiment while not violating the long run logic of hypothesis testing. The combined method is characterized by setting \\(\\alpha\\) and power \\(\\beta\\) before the experiment, then calculating a P value and rejecting the null hypothesis if the P value is less than the preset type I error rate. This means that the P value is considered a false-positive error rate specific to the data and also a measure of evidence against the null hypothesis. The P value fallacy is born from this statement, which assumes that an event can be seen simultaneously from a long run perspective (where the observed results are put together with other results that might have occurred in hypothetical repetitions of the experiment) and from a short run perspective (where the observed results are interpreted only with respect to the single experiment). However, these views are not reconcilable since a result cannot be at the same time an interchangeable (long-run) and unique (short-run) member of a group of results.\n\n\n\n\n\nI personally find this discussion fascinating and I believe that it is important to recognise the inconsistencies between the two alternative approaches to inference. The original authors of the two paradigms were well aware of the implications of their methods and never supported the combination of these. However, the combined approach has somehow become widely accepted in practice while its internal inconsistencies and conceptual limitations are hardly recognised.\nI feel that, since the two methods are perceived as “objective”, it is generally accepted that, if combined, they can produce reliable conclusions. This, however, is not necessarily true. Accepting at face value the significance result as a binary indicator of whether or not a relation is real is dangeroues and potentially misleading. This practice wants to show that conclusions are being drawn directly from the data, without any external influence, because direct inference from data to hypothesis is thought to result in mistaken conclusions only rarely and is therefore regarded as “scientific”.\nThis misguided approach has led to a much stronger emphasis towards the quantitative results alone (without any external input). In contrast, I believe that such perspective has the serious drawback of ignoring potentially useful information which is available (e.g. relevant medical knowledge or historical data) and which should be included in the analysis. Of course, I am aware of the potential issues that may arise from the selection and incorporation of external evidence, but I believe this should not be considered as “less reliable” or “more prone to mistakes” compared with the evidence from the available data. It is important that an agreement is reached about the selection of the type of evidence and methods to be used to perform the analysis solely based on their relevance with respect to the context analysed."

    "section": "",
    "text": "I have finally found some time to update the version for my R package missingHE, for which version 1.2.1 is now available on CRAN. I included two main features to the previous version of the package.\nFirst, I have added a new type of identifying restriction when fitting pattern mixture models through the function “pattern”. Before, only the complete case restriction was available, which identifies the distributions of the missing data with those from the completers. Now the alternative available case restriction is can also be selected, which relies on the distributions that can be identified among the non-completers to identify the distributions of the missing data. In this way, people can choose among at least two options for the type of restrictions and compare how this choice may affect the final estimates.\nSecond, I added a new accessory function called “ppc”, which allows to perform posterior predictive checks using the conditional parameters saved from the fitted model to generate replications of the data at each posterior iteration of the model. The function implements a relatively large number of checks, mostly taken from the R package bayesplot, which allow to assess the fit of the model to the observed data by type of outcome (effects and costs) and treatment group (control and intervention). For example, overalyed density plots can be generated to compare the empirical and replicated densities of the data to detect possible failures of the model.\n\n\n\nDensity plots for the observed and replicated data\n\n\nI feel this is very important as when fitting a Bayesian model it is crucial to assess whether the model seems to adequately capture the different characteristics of the observed data (e.g. skewness, structural values, etc.). A wide range of predictive checks are available, including histograms (see thumbnail pciture), scatterplots, error intervals, empirical cumulative distribution functions, statistics of interest and many others. In addition, these checks can be performed for each type of missingness model and parametric distribution chosen within missingHE.\n\n\n\n\n\nOf course, it is important to remember that, when dealing with missing data the fit of the model can only be checked with respect to the observed values and therefore this check is only partial since the fit to the unobserved values can never be checked. This is also why it is not meaningful to assess the fit of a model fitted under a missing not at random assumption because this is based on information which is not directly available from the data at hand and thus impossible to check."

I am actually looking forward to this as I am curious to see what type of conference ISPOR is, that is, whether I will be able to find some interesting works and have some “applied statistics”-related discussions or the attention is more placed on “economics and clinical” matters. From what I heard by other people who routinely attend the conference, there should be a bit of both sides, even though I really hope I will be able to see some intersting methods and engage in discussion with some authors.\nI know the conference is mainly related to address the needs of pharmaceutical and consultancy companies, but I hope I will be able to see some familiar faces there. Well, to be honest I know that some people I already know are going, which is good considering that their work is really cool. As for me, I will present the same work that I showed at ICTMC 2019 (some slides available here), but this time in the format of a poster, of which I am kind of very proud in terms of the final output, if I may say so.\nApart from this nice event, there are many things coming up when I will be back from the conference, which I really need to start working on. Mostly, these are related to some routine work for some trial analyses at PRIMENT, which by the way is advertising a new health economist job vacancy for those who might be interested. Other tasks include writing down and code a decision model on which I have been working since ages, papers review, other collaborations with different people, starting my co-supervision for a new PhD student at stats and, after I can find some free time, do some research work on my beloved missing data.

Unfortunately, I have recently been caught by a terrible flu which forced me to postpone my flight back to London of a week. The worst part is that I was basically a dead corpse moving around with high fever and an awful condition for more than 4 days. It was quite a bad experience which I rarely had in my life. I am just glad I survived this.\n\n\n\n\n\nGoing back to more interesting news. Before my cursed period, I was smart enough to work on different things and I am happy to announce a new update for my missingHE package, which is available both on my GitHub page and on the CRAN repository. Its new version is 1.3.2 and has the nice addition of making available more choices for the parametric distributions that can be selected in all main functions of the package to handle missing data in trial-based economic evaluations. In particular, it is now possible to choose among new probability distributions for the health outcomes, including continuous (Gamma, Weibull, Exponential, Logistic), discrete (Poisson, Negative Binomial) and binary (Bernoulli) distributions. These may be useful when the analysis is not based on utilities scores but some other types of effects, such as survival time, number of events or binary outcomes. I have also included some examples for each type of outcome in the MenSS dataset (available directly once installed the package on your machine) so that people can play around with the new distributions.\nAnother good news is that the last paper written with Michael about missing data handling in economic evaluations will soon be published in the February issue of JRSSA, which will make the final and official version of the article that can be cited, I think.\nFinally, an announcement about the one-day course I am holding together with my mates from the HEART group about an introduction to economic evaluations to people who are not familiar with health economics. The course will take place next month, I believe on Feb 11th, in central London (soon an update about the exact location) and, as the previous edition, I am happy to see that all spots have been taken and everything is sold out (well, to be precise the course is free …). Need to meet up with the others to make the last changes and prepare the slides but I am quite excited about this, given also the good response we got last time.\nNow I am (hopefully) ready to start the new year and there are many things already piling up on my list of things to do in the next days.

A critical problem in these analyses is that both effectiveness and cost data typically present some complexity (eg, nonnormality, spikes, and missingness) that should be addressed using appropriate methods. However, in routine analyses, standardised approaches are typically used, possibly leading to biassed inferences. We present a general Bayesian framework that can handle the complexity. We show the benefits of using our approach with a motivating example, the MenSS trial, for which there are spikes at one in the effectiveness and missingness in both outcomes. We contrast a set of increasingly complex models and perform sensitivity analysis to assess the robustness of the conclusions to a range of plausible missingness assumptions. We demonstrate the flexibility of our approach with a second example, the PBS trial, and extend the framework to accommodate the characteristics of the data in this study.

    "section": "",
    "text": "Abstract\nHealth economic evaluations based on patient-level data collected alongside clinical trials (e.g. health related quality of life and resource use measures) are an important component of the process which informs resource allocation decisions. Almost inevitably, the analysis is complicated by the fact that some individuals drop out from the study, which causes their data to be unobserved at some time point. Current practice performs the evaluation by handling the missing data at the level of aggregated variables (e.g. QALYs), which are obtained by combining the economic data over the duration of the study, and are often conducted under a missing at random (MAR) assumption. However, this approach may lead to incorrect inferences since it ignores the longitudinal nature of the data and may end up discarding a considerable amount of observations from the analysis. We propose the use of joint longitudinal models to extend standard cost-effectiveness analysis methods by taking into account the longitudinal structure and incorporate all available data to improve the estimation of the targeted quantities under MAR.

Nevertheless, complete case analysis or available case analysis dominated sensitivity analysis. Once imputation was chosen, missing costs were widely imputed at item-level via MI, whereas missing QOL was usually imputed at the more aggregated time point level during the follow-up via MI.

    "section": "",
    "text": "Introduction\nThe type of data used in economic evaluations typically come from a range of sources, whose evidence is combined to inform HTA decision-making. Traditionally, relative effectiveness data are derived from randomised controlled clinical trials (RCTs), while healthcare resource utilisation, costs and preference-based quality of life data may come from the same study that estimated the clinical effectiveness or not. A number of HTA agencies have developed their own methodological guidelines to support the generation of the evidence required to inform their decisions. In this context, the primary role of economic evaluation for HTA is not the estimation of the quantities of interest (e.g. the computation of point or interval estimation, or hypothesis testing), but to aid decision making. The implication of this is that the standard frequentist analyses that rely on power calculations and \\(P\\)-values to estimate statistical and clinical significance, typically used in RCTs, are not well-suited for addressing these HTA requirements.\nIt has been argued that, to be consistent with its intended role in HTA, economic evaluation should embrace a decision-theoretic paradigm and develop ideally within a Bayesian statistical framework to inform two decisions\n\nwhether the treatments under evaluation are cost-effective given the available evidence and\nwhether the level of uncertainty surrounding the decision is acceptable (i.e. the potential benefits are worth the costs of making the wrong decision).\n\nThis corresponds to quantify the impact of the uncertainty in the evidence on the entire decision-making process (e.g. to what extent the uncertainty in the estimation of the effectiveness of a new intervention affects the decision about whether it is paid for by the public provider).\n\n\nBayesian methods in HTA\nThere are several reasons that make the use of Bayesian methods in economic evaluations particularly appealing. First, Bayesian modelling is naturally embedded in the wider scheme of decision theory; by taking a probabilistic approach, based on decision rules and available information, it is possible to explicitly account for relevant sources of uncertainty in the decision process and obtain an optimal course of action. Second, Bayesian methods allow extreme flexibility in modelling using computational algorithms such as Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) methods; this allows to handle in a relatively easy way the generally sophisticated structure of the relationships and complexities that characterise effectiveness, quality of life and cost data. Third, through the use of prior distributions, the Bayesian approach naturally allows the incorporation of evidence from different sources in the analysis (e.g. expert opinion or multiple studies), which may improve the estimation of the quantities of interest; the process is generally referred to as evidence synthesis and finds its most common application in the use of meta-analytic tools. This may be extremely important when, as it often happens, there is only some partial (imperfect) information to identify the model parameters. In this case analysts are required to develop chain-of-evidence models. When required by the limitations in the evidence base, subjective prior distributions can be specified based on the synthesis and elicitation of expert opinion to identify the model, and their impact on the results can be assessed by presenting or combining the results across a range of plausible alternatives. Finally, under a Bayesian approach, it is straightforward to conduct sensitivity analysis to properly account for the impact of uncertainty in all inputs of the decision process; this is a required component in the approval or reimbursement of a new intervention for many decision-making bodies, such as NICE in the UK.\nThe general process of conducting a Bayesian analysis (with a view of using the results of the model to perform an economic evaluation) can be broken down in several steps, which are graphically summarized in Figure 1.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1: Diagram representation of the process for health economic evaluation.\n\n\n\nThe starting point is the identification of the decision problem, which defines the objective of the economic evaluation (e.g. the interventions being compared, the target population, the relevant time horizon). In line with the decision problem, a statistical model is constructed to describe the (by necessity, limited) knowledge of the underlying clinical pathways. This implies, for example, the definition of suitable models to describe variability in potentially observed data (e.g. the number of patients recovering from the disease because of a given treatment), as well as the epistemic uncertainty in the population parameters (e.g. the underlying probability that a random individual in the target population is cured, if given the treatment under study). At this point, all the relevant data are identified, collected and quantitatively sytnthesised to derive the estimates of the input parameters of interest for the model.\nThese parameter estimates (and associated uncertainties) are then fed to the economic model, with the objective of obtaining some relevant summaries indicating the benefits and costs for each intervention under evaluation. Uncertainty analysis represents some sort of detour from the straight path going from the statistical model to the decision analysis: if the output of the statistical model allowed us to know with perfect certainty the true value of the model parameters, then it would be possible to simply run the decision analysis and make the decision. Of course, even if the statistical model were the true representation of the underlying data generating process (which it most certainly is not), because the data may be limited in terms of length of follow up, or sample size, the uncertainty in the value of the model parameters would still remain. This parameter (and structural) uncertainty is propagated throughout the whole process to evaluate its impact on the decision-making. In some cases, although there might be substantial uncertainty in the model inputs, this may not turn out to modify substantially the output of the decision analysis, i.e. the new treatment would be deemed as optimal irrespectively. In other cases, however, even a small amount of uncertainty in the inputs could be associated with very serious consequences. In such circumstances, the decision-maker may conclude that the available evidence is not sufficient to decide on which intervention to select and require more information before a decision can be made.\nThe results of the above analysis can be used to inform policy makers about two related decisions:\n\nwhether the new intervention is to be considered (on average) value for money, given the evidence base available at the time of decision, and\nwhether the consequences (in terms of net health loss) of making the wrong decision would warrant further research to reduce this decision uncertaint.\n\nWhile the type and specification of the statistical and economic models vary with the nature of the underlying data (e.g. individual (ILD) level versus aggregated (ALD) data, the decision and uncertainty analyses have a more standardised set up.\n\n\nConclusions\nHTA has been slow to adopt Bayesian methods; this could be due to a reluctance to use prior opinions, unfamiliarity, mathematical complexity, lack of software, or conservatism of the healthcare establishment and, in particular, the regulatory authorities. However, the use of Bayesian approach has been increasingly advocated as an efficient tool to integrate statistical evidence synthesis and parameter estimation with probabilistic decision analysis in an unified framework for HTA. This enables a transparent evidence-based decision modelling, reflecting the uncertainty and the structural relationships in all the available data.\nWith respect to trial-based analyses, the flexibility and modularity of the Bayesian modelling structure are well-suited to jointly account for the typical complexities that affect ILD. In addition, prior distributions can be used as convenient means to incorporate external information into the model when the evidence from the data is limited or absent (e.g. for missing values). In the context of evidence synthesis, the Bayesian approach is particularly appealing in that it allows for all the uncertainty and correlation induced by the often heterogeneous nature of the evidence (either ALD only or both ALD and ILD) to be synthesised in a way that can be easily integrated within a decision modelling framework.\nThe availability and spread of Bayesian software among practitioners since the late 1990s, such as OpenBUGS or JAGS, has greatly improved the applicability and reduced the computational costs of these models. Thus, analysts are provided with a powerful framework, which has been termed comprehensive decision modelling, for simultaneously estimating posterior distributions for parameters based on specified prior knowledge and data evidence, and for translating this into the ultimate measures used in the decision analysis to inform cost-effectiveness conclusions."

    "text": "Introduction\nIn trial-based economic evaluation, some individuals are typically associated with missing data at some time point, so that their corresponding aggregated outcomes (e.g. quality-adjusted life-years) cannot be evaluated. Restricting the analysis to the complete cases is inefficient and can result in biased estimates, while imputation methods are often implemented under a missing at random (MAR) assumption. We propose the use of joint longitudinal models to extend standard approaches by taking into account the longitudinal structure to improve the estimation of the targeted quantities under MAR.\n\n\nStandard approach in trial-based CEA\nAccording to recent reviews, standard practice in trial-based CEAs handles missingness at the level of the aggregated outcomes and baseline variables. Indeed, estimates of interest are obtained by directly modeling the aggregated outcomes rather than the utility and cost data at each time. This requires the analyst to process the data collected on individual \\(i\\) at time \\(j\\) in treatment \\(t\\), to derive the aggregated measures over the study duration.\nFigure 1 shows a typical data set of trial-based CEA, formed by the sets of utility and cost variables collected at baseline \\(j = 0\\) and some follow-ups \\(j = 1,\\ldots,J\\). The graph represents the standard procedure for processing the data and identifying the variables used in the analysis.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1: Schematic representation of the standard procedure for processing trial-based CEA data\n\n\n\nA general limitation of any aggregated method is to ignore the longitudinal nature of the data and discard all follow-up values for partially observed individuals. Conversely, methods that handle missingness at each time point account for the longitudinal structure, incorporate all available evidence, and potentially make the missingness assumptions (e.g. missing at random or MAR) more reasonable.\n\n\nMethods\nWe propose the use of joint longitudinal models to extend standard approaches by taking into account the longitudinal structure to improve the estimation of the targeted quantities under MAR. We compare the results from methods that handle missingness at an aggregated (case deletion, baseline imputation, and joint aggregated models) and disaggregated (joint longitudinal models) level under MAR. The methods are compared using a simulation study and applied to data from 2 real case studies.\n\n\nConclusions\nJoint longitudinal models provide an alternative and potentially less biased approach for handling missing data with respect to current practice under a missing at random assumption. Methods that ignore some of the available information may be associated with biased results and mislead the decision-making process. This is a potentially serious issue for those who use these evaluations in their decision making, thus possibly leading to incorrect policy decisions about the cost-effectiveness of new treatment options."

    "text": "Modelling Framework\nwe extend the current methods for modelling trial-based partitioned survival cost-utility data, taking advantage of the flexibility of the Bayesian approach, and specify a joint probabilistic model for the health economic outcomes. We propose a general framework that is able to account for the multiple types of complexities affecting individual level data (correlation, missingness, skewness and structural values), while also explicitly modelling the dependence relationships between different types of quality of life and cost components.\nConsider a clinical trial in which patient-level information on a set of suitably defined effectiveness and cost variables is collected at \\(J\\) time points on \\(N\\) individuals, who have been allocated to \\(T\\) intervention groups. Assume that the primary endpoint of the trial is OS, while secondary endpoints include PFS, a self-reported health-related quality of life questionnaire (e.g. EQ-5D) and health records on different types of services (e.g. drug frequency and dosage, hospital visits, etc.). Following standard health economic notation, we denote with \\(\\boldsymbol e_{it}\\) and \\(\\boldsymbol c_{it}\\) the two sets of health economic outcomes (effectiveness and costs) collected for the \\(i\\)-th individual in treatment \\(t\\) of the trial. For simplicity, we define \\(\\boldsymbol e_{it}\\) and \\(\\boldsymbol c_{it}\\) based on the variables used in the analysis.\nThe effectiveness outcomes are represented by pre-progression (\\(e^{PFS}\\_{it}=\\text{QAS}^{\\text{PFS}}\\)) and post-progression (\\(e^{PPS}\\_{it}=\\text{QAS}^{\\text{PPS}}\\)) QAS data calculated using survival and utility data collected up to and beyond progression. We denote the full set of effectiveness variables as \\(\\boldsymbol e_{it}=(e^{\\text{PFS}}\\_{it},e^{\\text{PPS}}\\_{it})\\), formed by the pre and post-progression components. The cost outcomes are represented by a set of \\(K\\) variables (\\(c\\_{it}=c^k\\_{it}\\), for \\(k=1,\\ldots,K\\)) calculated based on \\(K\\) different types of health services and associated unit prices. We denote the full set of cost variables as \\(\\boldsymbol c\\_{it}=(c^1\\_{it},\\ldots,c^K\\_{it})\\), formed by the \\(K\\) different cost components.\nThe objective of the economic evaluation is to perform a patient-level partitioned survival cost-utility analysis by specifying a joint model \\(p\\boldsymbol e\\_{it}, \\boldsymbol c\\_{it} \\mid \\boldsymbol \\theta)\\), where \\(\\boldsymbol \\theta\\) denotes the full set of model parameters. Among these parameters, interest is in the marginal mean effectiveness and costs \\(\\boldsymbol \\mu=(\\mu\\_{et},\\mu\\_{ct})\\) which are used to inform the decision-making process. Different approaches can be used to specify \\(p\\boldsymbol e\\_{it}, \\boldsymbol c\\_{it} \\mid \\boldsymbol \\theta)\\). Here, we express the joint distribution as\n\\[\np(\\boldsymbol e_{it}, \\boldsymbol c_{it} \\mid \\boldsymbol \\theta) = p(\\boldsymbol e_{it} \\mid \\boldsymbol \\theta_e)p(\\boldsymbol c_{it} \\mid \\boldsymbol  e_{it} , \\boldsymbol  \\theta_c),\n\\tag{1}\\]\nwhere \\(p(\\boldsymbol e_{it} \\mid \\boldsymbol  \\theta_e)\\) is the marginal distribution of the effectiveness and \\(p(\\boldsymbol  c_{it} \\mid \\boldsymbol  e_{it} \\boldsymbol  \\theta_c)\\) is the conditional distribution of the costs given the effectiveness, respectively indexed by \\(\\boldsymbol  \\theta_e\\) and \\(\\boldsymbol  \\theta_c\\), with \\(\\boldsymbol  \\theta=(\\boldsymbol  \\theta_e,\\boldsymbol  \\theta_c)\\). We specify the model in Equation 1 in terms of a marginal distribution for the effectiveness and a conditional distribution for the costs. A key advantage of using a conditional factorisation, compared to a multivariate marginal approach, is that univariate models for each variable can be flexibly specified to tackle the idiosyncrasies of the data (e.g. non-normality ans spikes) while also capturing the potential correlation between the variables. We now describe how the two factors on the right-hand side of the Equation can be specified.\nFigure 1 provides a visual representation of the proposed modelling framework.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1: Visual representation of the proposed modelling framework\n\n\n\nThe effectiveness and cost distributions are represented in terms of combined “modules”- the red and blue boxes - in which the random quantities are linked through logical relationships. Notably, this is general enough to be extended to any suitable distributional assumption, as well as to handle covariates in each module.\n\n\nConclusions\nAlthough our approach may not be applicable to all cases, the data analysed are very much representative of the “typical” data used in partitioned survival cost-utility analysis alongside clinical trials. Thus, it is highly likely that the same features apply to other real cases. This is a very important, if somewhat overlooked problem, as methods that do not take into account the complexities affecting patient-level data, while being easier to implement and well established among practitioners, may ultimately mislead cost-effectiveness conclusions and bias the decision-making process."

A possible reason for this is that, while clinical effectiveness measures are often collected through self-reported questionnaires, which are naturally prone to missingness, cost measures rely more on clinical patient files which may ensure a higher completeness rate. It was not possible to confirm this interpretation in the reviewed studies due to the high proportions of articles not clearly reporting the missing rates in both 2003-2009 and 2009-2015 periods, for effects (\\(\\approx 45\\%\\) and \\(\\approx 38\\%\\)) and costs ( \\(\\approx 50\\%\\) and \\(\\approx 62\\%\\)). In addition, clinical outcomes are almost invariably the main objective of RCTs and are usually subject to more advanced and standardised analyses. Arguably, costs are often considered as an add-on to the standard trial: for instance, sample size calculations are almost always performed with the effectiveness measure as the only outcome of interest. Consequently, missing data methods are less frequently well thought through for the analysis of the costs. However, this situation is likely to change as cost data from different perspectives (e.g. caregivers, patients, society, etc.) are being increasingly used in trials, leading to the more frequent adoption of self-report cost data which may start to exhibit similar missingness characteristics to effect data.\nThe review identified only a few articles using more than one alternative method. In addition, these analyses are typically conducted without any clear justification about their underlying missing data assumptions and may therefore not provide a concrete assessment of the impact of missingness uncertainty. This situation indicates a gap in the literature associated with an under-implementation of sensitivity analysis, which may significantly affect the whole decision-making process outcome, under the perspective of a body who is responsible for providing recommendations about the implementation of alternative interventions for health care matters.\nLimiting the assessment of missingness assumptions to a single case is unlikely to provide a reliable picture of the underlying mechanism. This, in turn, may have a significant impact on the CEA and mislead its conclusions, suggesting the implementation of non-cost-effective treatments. Robustness analyses assess the sensitivity of the results to alternative missing data methods but do not justify the choice of these methods and their underlying assumptions about missingness which may therefore be inappropriate in the specific context analysed. By contrast, sensitivity analyses, which rely on external information to explore plausible alternative methods and missingness assumptions, represent an important and more appropriate tool to provide realistic assessments of the impact of missing data uncertainty on the final conclusions."

Indeed, the benchmark area on the top-right corner of the graphs is barely reached by less than \\(7\\%\\) of the articles, both for cost and effect data.\nOverall, the proportions of the studies associated with the lowest category (E) prevails in the majority of the years, with a similar pattern over time between missing costs and effects. All the articles that are associated with the top category (A) belong to the period 2013-2015, with the highest proportions of articles falling in this category being observed in 2015 for both outcomes. The opportunity of reaching such a target might be precluded by the choice of the method adopted, which may not be able to support less restrictive assumptions about missingness, even when this would be desirable. As a result, when simple methods cannot be fully justified it is necessary to replace them with more flexible ones that can relax assumptions and incorporate more alternatives. In settings such as those involving MNAR, sensitivity analysis might represent the only possible approach to account for the uncertainty due to the missingness in a principled way. However, due to the lack of studies either performing a sensitivity analysis or providing high quality scores on the assumptions, missingness is not adequately addressed in most studies. This could have the serious consequence of imposing too restrictive assumptions about missingness and affect the outcome of decision making."

The posterior distribution of the main quantities of interest (e.g. some suitable measures of costs and clinical benefits) is then summarised to assess the cost-effectiveness of a new intervention (\\(t=2\\)) against a standard intervention (\\(t=1\\)).\nmissingHE produces plots which compares the observed and imputed values for both cost and benefit measures in each treatment intervention considered to detect possible concerns about the plausibility of the imputation methods. In addition, the output of missingHE cab be analysed using different funtions in the R package BCEA which produces a synthesis of the decision process given the current evidence and uncertainty, as well as several indicators that can be used to perform Probabilistic Sensitivity Analysis to parameter and model uncertainty.\n\n\n\nExample of a graphical output from missingHE"

    "text": "News and updates about missingHE\n\nFrom 25/09/2019, the updated version (1.2.1) of missingHE has become available on CRAN, which allows to perform posterior predictive checks for each type of model as a further way to assess the fit of the model to the observed data.\n\nThe checks can be done by first setting the optional argument ppc = TRUE when fitting the model using one of the main function of the package. For example, when using selection to fit selection models you would have something like this:\n\nmodel.sel &lt;- selection(data = data, model.eff = e ~ age, model.cost = c ~ age + e, model.me = me ~ age, model.mc = mc ~ age, dist_e = \"norm\", dist_c = \"gamma\", type = \"MAR\", n.iter = 1000, ppc = TRUE)\n\nThen you can use the function ppc to perform different types of posterior predictive checks that you can choose among a set of pre-specified types using the type argument. For example, if we want to compare histograms of the empirical and predictive distributions of the effectiveness variable in one arm (e.g. control), then we can type\n\nppc(model.sel, type = \"histogram\", outcome = \"effects_arm1\")\n\nand we get something like this\n\n\n\nExample of posterior predictive checks in missingHE\n\n\n\nFrom 07/01/2020, the updated version (1.3.2) of missingHE has become available on CRAN, which allows to choose among more distributions for the effectiveness measures, including continuous (Gamma, Weibull, Exponential, Logistic), discrete (Poisson, Negative Binomial) and binary (Bernoulli) health outcomes.\n\nFor example, we can choose to specify a selection model assuming a Bernoulli distribution for the effects (if this is a binary outcome) and a LogNormal distribution for the costs\n\nmodel.sel &lt;- selection(data = data, model.eff = e ~ age, model.cost = c ~ age + e, model.me = me ~ 1, model.mc = mc ~ 1, dist_e = \"bern\", dist_c = \"lnorm\", type = \"MAR\")\n\n\nFrom 30/04/2020, the updated version (1.4.0) of missingHE has become available on CRAN, which allows to perform fit random effects for each type of model implemented. The random terms can be specified using the following notation\n\n\nmodel.sel &lt;- selection(data = data, model.eff = e ~ age + (age | site), model.cost = c ~ age + e + (age + e | site), model.me = me ~ age + (1 | site), model.mc = mc ~ age + (0 + age | site), dist_e = \"norm\", dist_c = \"gamma\", type = \"MAR\", n.iter = 10000, ppc = TRUE)\n\nI borrowed this notation, alongside with a couple of internal functions, from the lme4 package. The terms inside the brackets on the left of the bar are the terms for which the random effects are assumed (these must also be included as fixed effects). The term on the right of the bar is the clustering variable over which the random effects are specified.\nFor example the formula + (age | site) specifies random effects for the intercept and age across the values of the site variable. It aslo possible to specify random slope only models (i.e. remove the random intercept) by adding the term 0 + inside the brackets on the left of the bar.\nAll functions in the package have been updated to take into account the possibility that random effects are specified and to perform diagnostic and posterior predictive checks based on the random effects if these are included. In addition, a new generic function called coef is now available to extract the fixed or random effect terms from the effectiveness and cost models for each type of model in missingHE. For example, we can extract summary statistics for the fixed effects from the fitted selection model by using the command\n\ncoef(model.sel, random = FALSE)\n\nwhich prints something like this\n\n\n$Comparator\n$Comparator$Effects\n             mean    sd  lower upper\n(Intercept) 0.187 0.138 -0.083 0.457\nu.0         0.779 0.150  0.487 1.074\n\n$Comparator$Costs\n                mean      sd     lower    upper\n(Intercept)  236.716  49.778   142.237  335.056\ne           -963.484 418.694 -1772.698 -149.278\n\n\n$Reference\n$Reference$Effects\n             mean    sd lower upper\n(Intercept) 0.665 0.075 0.520 0.811\nu.0         0.285 0.087 0.115 0.458\n\n$Reference$Costs\n                mean      sd    lower   upper\n(Intercept)  185.896  40.642  103.211 262.101\ne           -187.828 349.812 -871.173 485.674\n\n\nIf we set random = TRUE, then summary statistics for the random effects terms are printed.\n\nFrom 10/06/2020 a new version (1.4.1) of missingHE is available to download from my GitHub page, which includes three vignettes providing some tutorials on how to use the functions of the package. Each vignette is specifically designed to help different types of users:\n\nThe first vignette is named Introduction_to_missingHE and is designed to provide some introductory summary about the use of the functions of the package based on the default settings, what the user needs to specify and how to interpret and extract the results. See the vignette here\nThe second vignette is named Fitting_MNAR_models_in_missingHE and is deisgned to help those who would like to explore MNAR assumptions and how this can be done within each main function of the package. See the vignette here\nThe third vignette is named Model_customisation_in_missingHE and is designed for those who are already familiar with the package but who would like to customise the functions in a more flexible way, for example by including random effects, using different priors or modelling assumptions. See the vignette here\n\nFrom 21/03/2023 a new version (4.2.0) of missingHE is available to download from my GitHub page, which includes an additional vignette providing some tutorials on how to extend the already existing functions within the package to fit longitudinal data. Some functions and options still need to be updated but the default configurations for either selection, pattern, or hurdle functions can now be applied to two-arms within-trial longitudinal data economic evaluations. See the vignette here\n\nMore information, including new updates, about missingHE can be found on my dedicated GitHub repository or via the most up to date version of the package on CRAN."

    "text": "Installation\nThere are two ways of installing missingHE. A stable version (currently 4.2.0) is packaged and available from CRAN. You can simply type on your R terminal\n\ninstall.packages(\"missingHE\")\n\nThe second way involves using the development version of missingHE, which is available from GitHub - this will usually be updated more frequently and may be continuously tested. On Windows machines, you need to install a few dependencies, including Rtools first, e.g. by running\n\npkgs &lt;- c(\"R2jags\",\"ggplot2\",\"gridExtra\",\"BCEA\",\"ggmcmc\",\"loo\",\"Rtools\",\"devtools\", \"utils\")\nrepos &lt;- c(\"https://cran.rstudio.com\") \ninstall.packages(pkgs,repos=repos,dependencies = \"Depends\")\n\nbefore installing the package using devtools:\n\ndevtools::install_github(\"AnGabrio/missingHE\", build_vignettes = TRUE)\n\nThe optional argument build_vignettes = TRUE allows to install the vignettes of the package locally on your computer. These consist in brief tutorials to guid the user on how to use and customise the models in missingHE using different functions of the package. Once the package is installed, they can be accessed by using the command\n\nutils::browseVignettes(package = \"missingHE\")\n\nAll models implemented in missingHE are written in the BUGS language using the software JAGS, which needs to be installed from its own repository and instructions for installations under different OS can be found online. Once installed, the software is called in missingHE via the R package R2jags. Note that the missingHE package is currently under active development and therefore it is advisable to reinstall the package directly from GitHub before each use to ensure that you are using the most updated version."

JAGS is a free software based on the Bayesian inference Using Gibbs Sampling (informally BUGS) language at the base of WinBUGS/OpenBUGS but, unlike these programs, it is written in C++ and is platform independent. The latest version of JAGS can be downloaded from Martyn Plummer’s repository and is available for different OS. There are different R packages which function as frontends for JAGS. These packages make it easy to process the output of Bayesian models and present it in publication-ready form. In this brief introduction, I will specifically focus on the R2jags package (Su et al. (2015)) and show how to fit JAGS models using this package."
