### Abstract

The concept of non-inferiority is widely adopted in randomized trials comparing transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) and surgical aortic valve replacement (SAVR). However, uncertainty exists regarding the long-term outcomes of TAVR, and non-inferiority may be difficult to assess. We performed a systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized trials comparing TAVR and SAVR, with a specific emphasis on the non-inferiority margin for 5-year all-cause mortality. A systematic search was applied to 3 electronic databases. 

Randomized trials comparing TAVR and SAVR were included. Bayesian methods were implemented to evaluate the posterior probability of non-inferiority at different trial non-inferiority margins under either a vague, Cauchy, or a literature-based prior. Primary outcomes were 5-year actuarial all-cause mortality, and the probability of non-inferiority at various transformed trial non-inferiority margins. Secondary outcomes were long-term survival and 1- and 2-year actuarial survival.

Eight trials ($n=8698$ patients) were included. Kaplan–Meier-derived $5$-year survival was $61.6\%$ ($95\%$ CI $59.8–63.5\%$) for TAVR, and $63.7\%$ ($95\%$ CI $61.9–65.6\%$) for SAVR. Six trials ($n=6370$ patients) reported all-cause mortality at $5$-year follow-up. Under a vague prior, the posterior median relative risk for all-cause mortality of TAVR was $1.14$, compared to SAVR (95% credible interval $1.06-1.22$, probability of relative risk $<1.00=0.01\%$, I2 $= 0\%$). Similar results in terms of point estimate and uncertainty measures were obtained using frequentist methods. Based on the various trial non-inferiority margins, the results of the analysis suggest that non-inferiority at $5$-years is no longer likely.
