### Abstract

Previously, we performed the multicentre INCEPTION trial, randomizing patients with refractory out-of-hospital cardiac arrest (OHCA) to extracorporeal cardiopulmonary resuscitation (ECPR) or conventional cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CCPR). Frequentist analysis showed no statistically significant treatment effect for the primary outcome; $30$-day survival with a favourable neurologic outcome (cerebral performance category score of $1-2$). To facilitate a probabilistic interpretation of the results, we present a Bayesian re-analysis of the INCEPTION trial.

We analysed survival with a favourable neurologic outcome at $30$ days and $6$ months under a minimally informative prior in the intention-to-treat population. Effect sizes are presented as absolute risk differences (ARDs) and relative risks (RRs), with $95\%$ credible intervals (CrIs). We estimated posterior probabilities at various thresholds, including the minimal clinically important difference (MCID) ($5\%$ ARD), based on expert consensus, and performed sensitivity analyses under sceptical and literature-based priors. The mean ARD for 30-day survival with a favourable neurologic outcome was $3.6\%$ ($95\%$ CrI $-9.5-16.7\%$), favouring ECPR, with a median RR of $1.22$ ($95\%$ CrI $0.59-2.51$). The posterior probability of an MCID was $42\%$ at $30$ days and $42\%$ at $6$ months, in favour of ECPR.
